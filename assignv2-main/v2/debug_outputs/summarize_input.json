By Sam Hargrave Posted: December 16, 2025 James Gunn's DCU recently debuted new logos for its biggest 2026 projects, Supergirl and Lanterns . DC Studios officially began marketing Supergirl at CCXP with a special booth , laying the groundwork for its imminent first trailer. In doing so, the DCU is finally on the road to its next big release in six months' time with Supergirl , which hits theaters on June 26, 2026. That will be followed later in the year with Lanterns ' HBO premiere in late summer and Clayface , which will bring its unique blend of Gotham City body horror to screens on September 11, 2026. As Warner Bros. and DC Studios begin to rev the hype engine for Supergirl , an official new logo for the June 2026 blockbuster was released online. The Kingdom Come-inspired design will be familiar to the many who caught Superman this year, with a unique shimmering coming from the text to hint at its galactic setting. DC Studios The home of the DCU also offered an alternate logo for Supergirl with a more neon, retro aesthetic, a bigger departure from James Gunn's Superman . DC Studios As the Super-Family famously wears their mutual House of El symbol across their chests, Supergirl 's logo is mostly the same as Superman 's. Still, the crest received some minor updates, such as replacing the yellow bevel with black, possibly signalling Kara Zor-El's darker personality compared to her hopeful cousin. DC Studios DC Studios may use both Supergirl logos over the coming months as part of its marketing campaign, possibly highlighting her varied personality. That said, the Superman -esque design looks to be the movie's primary logo. DC Studios Supergirl will fly into theaters on June 26, 2026, directed by Craig Gillespie with a script from Ana Nogueira, based on the Woman of Tomorrow comics. The DCU blockbuster will star Milly Alcock's Supergirl, Eve Ridley's Ruthye, Jason Momoa's Lobo, and Matthias Schoenaerts' Krem of the Yellow Hills. Next up after that will be Lanterns , which also recently received an updated logo with distinct differences from the one worn by Nathan Fillion's Guy Gardner (who will appear in the HBO series) in this summer's Superman . DC Studios Some fans are convinced that the swirls hidden in Lanterns ' new logo are hinting at a major Justice League villain . Some have theorized that the sci-fi mystery series may introduce the Centre, given James Gunn's previous promise that Lanterns will be integral to setting up the DCU's larger storyline. DC Studios The logo itself differs greatly to the one featured in 2011's Green Lantern , utilising a more bluish-green hue and not including the full outer circle. DC Lanterns enthusiasts got a brief look at what series stars Kyle Chandler and Aaron Pierre will look like suited up as Hal Jordan and John Stewart, respectively, for the eight-episode True Detective -inspired series via an HBO featurette. Also included in the teaser was a look at the show's text logo. DC The text uses a relatively standard sans-serif font and appears perhaps a bit less flashy than past logos associated with Green Lantern. The 2011 movie featured a font that evoked a sci-fi aesthetic, whereas Green Lantern: The Animated Series used a more over-the-top lettering with vibrant colors. DC Despite recently delaying the series' premiere into late summer, fans are hopeful that more news will be imminent after a trailer description revealed a fourth Green Lantern who will appear after footage was shown to select press and audiences. DC Clayface still hasn't launched its marketing campaign and may not until the spring ahead of its September 11, 2026, but the logo for the Batman villain spin-off was revealed on set . The DCU body horror was crafted by Mike Flanagan and directed by James Watkins, with Tom Rhys Harries stepping into the leading role. The DCU's Global Takeover Is Just Beginning, And I Can't Wait For now, DC Studios seems to want all eyes on Supergirl , going as far as to place a countdown in Times Square, New York City, to promote its first trailer. Fans saw over the summer that Warner Bros. pulled out all the stops to market Superman globally, and they may be hoping to carry that momentum forward into Supergirl . As Lanterns won't premiere until late Summer 2026, likely a few months after Supergirl , the two may have to split the spotlight for a period. However, complete focus may not shift to the HBO series until July and beyond, once Supergirl has been and gone, hopefully driving interest in the DCU to new heights. Of course, amongst the chaos, DC Studios is sure to put a bold push on Clayface in the hopes of attracting horror, non-superhero audiences to the DCU. With all three projects potentially having some period of overlapping marketing, 2026 could be a huge year for DC, dragging the blue brand back into the public eye. Currently, it appears that DC Studios' 2026 offerings will be limited to just those three live-action projects (two movies and one HBO series). It's possible that slate could be complemented with an animated offering later in the year ( such as the Blue Beetle sequel series ), but that remains unconfirmed for now.

Sign in to your ScreenRant account Summary Generate a summary of this story follow Follow followed Followed Like Like Thread Log in Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents: Try something different: Show me the facts Explain it like I’m 5 Give me a lighthearted recap All of the three 2025 movies that currently have a box office result of $1 billion or more all have the same origins, making their shared success this year even more noteworthy. The past few years have seen many movies cross the $1 billion threshold when it comes to their worldwide box office, with some releases seeming basically destined for this result, and some surprise successes netting this amount to keep things interesting. 2025 has been no exception, as multiple films have achieved this major milestone with their theatrical results, showing that movies can still enjoy immense theatrical success, even in an era where streaming is in many ways bigger than ever. Interestingly, 2025's current $1B+ movies all share one key thing in common, proving the potential of one often underappreciated corner of the world of cinema. 2025's 3 $1B+ Movies Are All Follow-Ups To Animated Movies Nick and Judy rowing a boat in Zootopia 2 © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures / Courtesy Everett Collection Though 2025's biggest box office hits are different in many other regards, the three films in question all share an origin of sorts, as they're all follow-ups to animated movies - with Ne Zha 2 having made $2 billion with its worldwide box office, Zootopia 2 having just become 2025's second-highest grossing movie of 2025 by reaching the $1.1 billion mark, and Lilo & Stitch coming in third for the year with its own $1 billion results. Of course, it's worth noting that, while Ne Zha 2 and Zootopia 2 are animated movies themselves that serve as direct sequels to the stories they follow up on, Lilo & Stitch is a live-action remake of the original 2002 animated Disney movie. However, all three still ultimately follow up on the original animated movies their respective series began with - which is interesting to note, even though this trend may be broken by 2025's next possible $1B movie. 2025's $1B Movie Rule May Be Broken In The Final Days Of The Year Closeup of Kiri (Sigourney Weaver) in Avatar: Fire & Ash Though 2025 is in its final days, there are still some major movies on the way for the year - and the film that looks set to be the biggest of this time period is, of course, that of the third Avatar movie, Avatar: Fire and Ash . With both previous Avatar movies having garnered well over $2 billion, it stands to reason that the third film will at absolute worst come close to these previous results, adding it to 2025's $1B+ movie roster. This would make it the outlier among 2025's existing movies that have broken the $1 billion box office mark, which is notable both in that it would show animated movie follow-ups weren't the only films that were capable of reaching this milestone in 2025 , and in that it would further reflect how impressive these $1 billion results were, since their only box office peer would be the next installment in a $5 billion movie series.

Sign in to your ScreenRant account Summary Generate a summary of this story follow Follow followed Followed Like Like Thread Log in Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents: Try something different: Show me the facts Explain it like I’m 5 Give me a lighthearted recap 2026 is scheduled to have a considerable range of monumentally exciting sci-fi movies released within it - though some of these films have more hype built up for them than others for at least the time being. Historically, sci-fi is a genre that can be explored in an astronomical assortment of ways - from gritty and grueling dystopian tales, to remarkably light-hearted romps through futuristic lands and concepts. The limitless possibilities of sci-fi stories go some way to explain why the genre also tends to consistently be one of the most popular and sought after when it comes to theatrically released films. Indeed, based on 2026's sci-fi movie lineup, it seems the year is set to be rife with criticial and commercial hits within this realm. Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die Sam Rockwell faces the camera in Good Luck Have Fun Don't Die While those lucky enough to attend the 2025 Fantastic Fest did garner an opportunity to watch a preview screening of sci-fi comedy Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die , the movie's full theatrical release is set to take place on February 13, 2026 , making it one of the first sci-fi films to release in the year. Based on Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die 's trailer - and strikingly solid 94% Rotten Tomatoes reviews from those who saw it early - it seems the film will be helping kick off the year in suitably stellar fashion. With a time travel premise that sees an unlucky inhabitant of a dystopian future journey back in time to try and save the world from its fate - recruiting a selection of seemingly random people from an LA diner in the hopes of creating a team that can protect humanity - it's clear Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die will be as entertaining as it is visually striking, making it an early must-watch for 2026. Flowervale Street Flowervale Street poster The mystery around Flowervale Street has worked in its favor in some ways when it comes to building hype around it from those who are aware of its existence. However, the relative lack of information we have about the movie does mean the main excitement around the film comes from the names that are currently attached to it, which include J.J. Abrams being one of the film's producers, and Anne Hathaway and Ewan McGregor being some of the main actors involved. Thus far, what's been teased for Flowervale Street seems to promise an exciting story, complete with at least one dinosaur and a street that's being affected by sci-fi phenomena, altering the lives of lead characters the Platt family forever - though more specifics about this installment will seemingly only become clearer closer to its scheduled August 14 release date . The Dog Stars The Dog Stars book cover Ridley Scott's history in the sci-fi genre is impossible to miss, with the likes of Alien , Blade Runner , and later The Martian cementing his reputation as someone who is able to give futuristic worlds and larger-than-life stories a grounded edge that makes them truly gripping throughout. As such, it's no surprise Scott's next sci-fi film, The Dog Stars , is one many are very excited to see release on March 27 . This is doubly true given the movie is adapting a book of the same name, which promises a suitably soulful and dramatic story of a man, his dog, and the gunman they befriended existing in a post-apocalyptic world, before one radio transmission sends the protagonists on an unexpected mission. Steven Spielberg's 2026 Movie Steven Spielberg at the London Premiere of The Thursday Murder Club John Rainford/Cover Images With Steven Spielberg being one of the biggest names in the directing sphere still decades into his career, his impending 2026 sci-fi release is naturally one that has a lot of intrigue and excitement around it - particularly since it appears details about the film may be being kept secret for as long as possible, given the name of the movie still isn't known, though its release is schedule for only months away on June 12, 2026 . Set to feature a range of talented actors - including Colman Domingo, Wyatt Russell, Emily Blunt and Colin Firth - Steven Spielberg's movie is reportedly based on an original idea from the director, and will be the first movie he's directed to hit cinemas since 2022's The Fabelmans . As such, there seems to be plenty of reasons to be excited about the film, even if we know little other than the fact it doesn't seem Steven Spielberg's sci-fi film is set to play in IMAX in 2026. Project Hail Mary Ryan Gosling in Project Hail Mary Combining a sci-fi story that is in many ways inherently suited to a big-screen adaptation - as is the case for Andy Weir's 2021 book Project Hail Mary - and some talented actors and directors seems a recipe built for success. As such, it's worth noting that Project Hail Mary is directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller - who may be most recognizable as the directors of the Spider-Verse films - and has Ryan Gosling play the movie's lead character, which all seems to suggest the film could well become one of the bigger movies of 2026 when it releases on March 20 . Project Hail Mary centers around Ryland Grace, a scientist whose primary challenge in the story comes when he finds himself on a space mission with no memory of who he is or what he was striving to do. Grace soon encounters an alien lifeform who becomes his main companion in this complex set of circumstances, with their dynamic unfolding into a truly emotional story about two very different worlds. Hunger Games: Sunrise On The Reaping The Hunger Games has seen a resurgence in popularity thanks to 2023's The Hunger Games: A Ballad Of Songbirds And Snakes , which itself built hype for fellow Hunger Games prequel Hunger Games: Sunrise On The Reaping - a film that is set to release on November 20, 2026 . Sunrise On The Reaping covers the story of Katniss' mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, and what his first Hunger Games was like - with the original books and movies providing some details regarding this matter, but leaving much of the 50th annual Hunger Games otherwise a mystery. Hunger Games: Sunrise On The Reaping 's trailer has already demonstrated how the film will balance the action and tragedies that make the series so gripping, while also delving further into the history of both Haymitch himself, and the world of Panem, shedding more light on the events of the main timeline. Supergirl Milly Alcock as Supergirl in the Superman movie While there have been a fair number of live-action DC movies over the years, the films often veer away from showing the further reaches of the comic universe, instead focusing more squarely on Earth and the events that take place on it. This makes it all the more exciting that Supergirl seems set to do just the opposite with its story, since it looks to adapt the comic run of Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, which takes place almost entirely on a range of different alien planets that are much unlike our own in many ways. Not only does this ensure Supergirl gets a more directly sci-fi-esque story - unlike Kal-El's adventures in the DCU's first movie, Superman - it also means the DC Universe's further corners can be fleshed out as early as its second film thanks to Supergirl 's June 26, 2026 release date , which has major implications for the wider franchise, too. Dune 3 Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides in Dune 2 looking off-screen Sci-fi's favorite alien worm series is set to return once more with the movie reboot's third installment, which is scheduled to debut on December 18, 2026 , and take viewers back to the world of Arrakis as Paul Atreides tries to unite its people to fight against the threat of House Harkonnen, who seek to take over the planet and its valuable resources. Now the first two installments of this series have built up a solid audience for the films and their epic story of how the cosmos are changed by the family of House Atreides forever, it seems the third film has a prime opportunity to delve into some of the biggest events in the book series - and introduce some of the bigger moral questions and plot twists that the story has to offer. Thus far, the 2020s Dune series has done a striking job of translating the sprawling sci-fi worlds of the books to life - both in its visuals and in the acting of its cast of characters - and it seems things are likely to only continue to amp up in this vital chapter of the story in every regard, painting a decidedly thrilling picture of what's to come for the franchise. The Mandalorian And Grogu Grogu eating cookies in The Mandalorian Mentioning there's hype for an upcoming Star Wars movie is perhaps as obvious as saying water is wet, even though the decades-old sci-fi world has seen some more divided reception in the past few years - which naturally bodes well for The Mandalorian and Grogu when it releases on May 22, 2026 . The Mandalorian and Grogu focusing on two of the most beloved new characters from the franchise's recent years should go some way to convince even those who have not been as keen on Star Wars' newer directions to give the film a chance, which suggests the already staggering brand appeal at play here can be capitalized on even further. With the opportunity to be a space-faring action-packed adventure, a follow-up on the aftermath of some of the biggest events in Star Wars' timeline, and a tale of an unusual found family finding their place in the galaxy, Din Djarin and Grogu's film story should theoretically have a little of something for every kind of Star Wars fan, and then some. Avengers: Doomsday Fantastic Four First Steps Post-Credits scene of Franklin Richards and Doctor Doom The sheer scope and scale teased for Avengers: Doomsday means it's inherently the biggest sci-fi movie of 2026 in terms of hype, even though the MCU has, much like Star Wars, had some more divided reception in recent months and years. The MCU has grown bigger and bigger over the course of its almost two-decade-long run, both in terms of the size of its world and stories, and in terms of its reputation. Doomsday will be the first Avengers movie since the genre-defining success of Avengers: Endgame - which sets a high bar for film in terms of what is possible for it when it releases on December 18, 2026 , but also ensures that a monumental amount of people are eagerly awaiting what this next chapter of the Avengers series holds, even if some may have their doubts about what might come next. With this next part of the MCU bringing back several major figures for the franchise - including many big Fox X-Men actors, and of course the return of Robert Downey Jr, this time playing Doctor Doom - the stage is set for a truly colossal story that pays tribute to not just every part of the MCU that came before it, but also to the wider Marvel movie world, thanks to the franchise's recent sci-fi forays into the concept of the multiverse.

And all this sets our\nsights high for the coming year. Lucky, then, the studios and directors we\nhave given our time and money to will be delivering exactly what we want. Steven Spielberg returns to the broader genre for the first time\nsince 2018’s Ready Player One, and to alien films specifically since 2008’s\nIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Ridley Scott is also\ndusting off his lenses for an adaptation of Peter Heller’s The Dog Stars. Marvel fans who have felt let down by the middling films the\nsuperhero giant has put out this decade have a new Spider-Man and Avengers\nto look forward to, and DC die-hards get to see Supergirl finally take the\nlimelight on screen again after decades spent MIA. Other big franchises getting another chance to shine include\nThe Hunger Games, Mortal Kombat, and The Mandalorian (in its silver screen\ndebut), but there is also plenty for the indie crowd, with Maggie Gyllenhaal’s gangster\nmonster movie The Bride!, and Na Hong-jin’s alien thriller Hope - his first multinational\nfeature. It’s a full roster, and suffice to say, the following 20 movies are certain to become your most anticipated sci-fi films of 2026, if they’re not\nalready. 20. The Dresden Sun VMI Worldwide UK release date: February (day TBC) Science fiction fans who are hoping The Dresden Sun might be\nan adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse 5 will be sorely disappointed\n(our day will come!), but for everyone else, Michael Ryan’s upcoming picture\npromises an exciting new entry in a rather niche genre: the sci-fi heist\nmovie. The film features converging narratives which see an expert mercenary\nwork an inside job to steal a big corporation’s most valued asset, while an\ninsurance analyst is caught in a web of corporate rivals and fraud, ending up\non the run from a military contractor. The first look trailer and those few\nimages available of The Dresden Sun so far suggest a high-tech, neon, Blade Runner\naesthetic paired with a modern corporate espionage crime thriller’s steely\nedge. It definitely doesn’t have anything like the budget of many\nof the other sci-fi flicks heading our way next year, but it’s got an\nintriguing cast in Christina Ricci, Steven Ogg (Trevor from GTA V), and Mena\nSuvari, and looks like it’s going to be a solid streaming watch.

And 2026 is positively stuffed with genre films from some of the world’s most respected filmmakers: the last time we had Steven Spielberg and Ridley Scott release a sci-fi movie in the same year was in 1982. With apologies to any superhero movies that might happen to contain sci-fi elements (no Supergirl or Avengers: Doomsday here), please enjoy this list of the most exciting genre films coming up next year. Big budgets, small budgets, comedy elements, splashes of horror – there really is something for just about everyone in the list below. Let’s begin, then, with a cautionary tale about indulging in carnal relations with a household appliance… Soulm8te – 9th January (or perhaps not…) A shot from M3GAN 2.0. No official imagery available for Soulm8te at the time of writing, readers. Credit: Universal The year gets off to a rather saucy start with this spin-off from Blumhouse’s killer robot thriller, M3GAN. Soulm8te is said to be taking the franchise into erotic territory, as a lonely widower buys a gynoid to keep him company – only for the wretched thing to start wreaking havoc. Directed by Kate Dolan and starring David Rysdahl and Lily Sullivan, it sounds like similar territory to Subservience , a 2024 thriller starring Megan Fox, and numerous other films where human-robot relations turn sour. Will it be a bigger hit than M3GAN 2.0 , which was an unexpected disappointment in 2025? Dunno m8. (Since this post was written, Universal has reportedly taken Soulm8te off its 2026 calendar, and is now shopping it to other distributors. We haven’t seen any official confirmation of this as yet, but we’ll update this list if we do.) Bulk – January and February Noah Taylor on restrained form in Bulk. Credit: Film Four. British director Ben Wheatley’s career has spanned indie drama and horror ( Down Terrace, Kill List ) and expensive thrillers ( Rebecca, Meg 2: The Trench ). Bulk sees the filmmaker explore mind-bending science fiction, albeit in a uniquely DIY fashion. Shot on a tiny budget on domestic cameras (iPhones, SVHS and the like), Bulk sees protagonist Corey Harlan (Sam Riley) head off into a bizarre, dimension-spanning odyssey that includes an enigmatic scientist (Alexandra Maria Lara) and a variety of eccentric characters played by Noah Taylor. That Harlan’s odyssey takes place almost entirely in a single nondescript house doesn’t make it any less epic. Touring UK cinemas large and small in early 2026 , Bulk is possibly the most mesmerising, unusual genre films you’ll see all year. You certainly won’t forget it in a hurry. 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple – 14th January Ralph Fiennes holds his temple in 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple. Credit: Sony. Director Nia DaCosta takes over from Danny Boyle for the next chapter in a planned 28 Years trilogy, and by all accounts, this one’s an absolute corker. Picking up the thread from 2025’s sequel, it’s another journey into a country riven by superstition, disease and territorialism. We do wonder where screenwriter Alex Garland gets his out-there ideas from. Mercy – 23rd January We’ll try to go into this one with an open mind. It’s the latest film from director Timur Bekmambetov, previously known for the flashy action thriller, Wanted , but more recently associated with a series of ‘screenlife’ thrillers. He was producer on War Of The Worlds – a version of HG Wells’ invasion text viewed entirely through a computer interface. Starring Ice Cube and a supporting cast of Amazon goods and services, it was one of the most bafflingly misguided films of 2025 . But anyway: Mercy . Starring Chris Pratt, it’s set in a Minority Report -esque future where the entire legal system has been handed over to AI. Chris Pratt plays a detective who’s accused of murdering his own wife, and has 90 minutes to convince an icy digital judge (Rebecca Ferguson) of his innocence – or face summary execution. The perplexing thing about Mercy isn’t so much the premise as the venue; Amazon MGM’s giving it a big cinema push, including a run on 3D IMAX screens. The trailer dresses the film up a bit, but it’s still mostly a single-location thriller with plot points unfolding on computer screens. We’re not sure it screams big-screen, bring-your-chums entertainment – but again, we’ll keep an open mind. Suggested product Film Stories \"I Try Not To Do Snark...\" Tee Merch £22.99 Suggested product Nicolas Cage Appreciation Coasters Merch £12.99 Cold Storage – 13th February 2026 The Last Of Us played for laughs? Quite possibly. A storage facility becomes overrun by a mind-controlling fungus in a sci-fi comedy written by David Koepp – adapted from his own novel – and directed by Jonny Campbell ( Alien Autopsy ). Georgina Campbell ( Barbarian ) and Joe Keery ( Stranger Things ) star, and there’s a role too for Liam Neeson, who’s made some, er, interesting career choices of late. That’s hardly the film’s fault, though. The trailer is filled with gore and sweary, gross-out humour, and it all looks tremendously entertaining. Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die – 20th February Another sci-fi comedy, Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die marks the return of director Gore Verbinski ( Rango , the Pirates Of The Caribbean franchise). Sam Rockwell stars as a dishevelled, oddly-dressed man who stumbles into a diner one night insisting that he’s from the future – and that he needs the customers’ help to avert a future war against machines. The film made its debut at 2025’s Fantastic Fest, where it garnered almost universally positive reviews. The supporting cast includes Zazie Beetz, Michael Pena and Juno Temple. We can’t wait. In The Blink Of An Eye – 27th February We were a bit worried about this film for a while. Finished in March 2025 , In The Blink Of An Eye sat without a release date for several months, with rumours of reshoots doing the rounds. The sci-fi drama is now making its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, meaning it’ll screen there between late January and the 1st February. From Wall-E and John Carter director Andrew Stanton, In The Blink Of An Eye is an epoch-spanning fable that takes us from humanity’s earliest days to a spacecraft 200 years in the future. The script, by Colby Day, was on the Black List of best unproduced screenplays in 2016, and it’s a terrific read : seamlessly eliding between eras and characters at various points in history, all building to a truly emotional climax. Day also wrote Spaceman, an Adam Sandler sci-fi you can find on Netflix; In The Blink Of An Eye promises to be another terrific genre piece. (Unfortunately, In The Blink Of An Eye doesn’t appear to be getting a cinema release after its festival debut; instead, Disney has opted to send it directly to its Hulu screening service on the 27th February.) The Bride! – 26th March Not connected to Guillermo del Toro’s baroque take on Frankenstein made for Netflix, The Bride is the latest film from actor turned director Maggie Gyllenhaal. It stars Jessie Buckley as a mortally injured woman revived by Anette Bening’s Dr Euphronius, while Christian Bale plays the monster and the Bride’s betrothed. Moving Mary Shelley’s Gothic novel into the roaring (19)20s, it looks like a sumptuous and beautifully-designed tragic romance. Project Hail Mary – 20th March Based on the novel by Andy Weir, Project Hail Mary sees Ryan Gosling’s unassuming science teacher blasted into space in a last-ditch effort to save humanity. The trailer gave away a bit more of the book’s events than we were expecting, so maybe avoid that if you want to go into the cinema completely cold. The adaptation’s by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, so expect plenty of humour and heart as well as Weir’s plausibly detailed science fiction. In a case of unfortunate cosmic timing, Project Hail Mary places it rather near another major sci-fi film from a director whose last big hit was also a Weir adaptation… The Dog Stars – 27th March There aren’t any images for The Dog Stars kicking around yet, so please accept this still from 1980s children’s TV show, Children Of The Dog Star. We used to quite like it. Some of Ridley Scott’s most beloved and influential movies are in the sci-fi genre – Alien, Blade Runner and The Martian (the Weir adaptation we were on about above) are all markedly different in tone, but all classics in their own way. We’re excited to see what Scott’s done with The Dog Stars, then: adapted from Peter Heller’s novel, it’s set in a future world ravaged by a pandemic. Holed up in an aircraft hangar, the two protagonists – Jacog Elordi’s pilot, Hig and Josh Brolin’s sniper, Bangley – are coaxed back into the open world by a mysterious signal. Margaret Qualley, Guy Pearce and Benedict Wong also star. Given Scott’s visual flair – even his uneven Alien prequels were often lovely to look at – this is arguably one of our most anticipated genre films of the year. The Mandalorian And Grogu – 22nd May Lucasfilm’s first Star Wars movie in seven years, The Mandalorian And Grogu takes the hit Disney+ series out for a big screen spin-off – making it the Holiday On The Buses of space fantasies. We don’t know much about the plot, and frankly, we don’t need to know: as long as director Jon Favreau delivers on the pace and spectacle, we should be in for a pulpy, entertaining evening at the pictures. Pedro Pascal, Grogu, Sigourney Weaver and Jeremy Allan White all star – the latter as the alarmingly buff son of the late Jabba. Disclosure Day – 12th June It’s an absurdly stuffed year for respected directors making genre films. And Disclosure Day could be the biggest of the lot: it’s the latest from Steven Spielberg, and a return to the UFO-based subject matter of Close Encounters Of The Third Kind. It’s written by David Koepp (see Cold Storage earlier), who previously worked with Spielberg on the adapted screenplay for Jurassic Park, and following the autobiographical drama of The Fabelmans , it’s a return to the summer blockbuster experience the filmmaker essentially invented. Emily Blunt, Josh O’Connor and Wyatt Russell star; it’s about an attempt to reveal the truth about alien intelligence to the world, and a shadowy attempt to stop it. We think. The trailer’s big on intrigue and low on plot specifics. It compels us, though. Flowervale Street – 10th August A generic picture of a dinosaur, courtesy of Public Domain Pictures. It Follows was one of the great horror movies of the 2010s, and here comes its director, David Robert Mitchell, with some sort of time-travelling IMAX thriller involving dinosaurs. Ewen McGregor and Anne Hathaway are the starriest names among the warm-blooded cast. At present, we don’t know a whole lot more about this one, either, but Mitchell is a hugely talented director of both comedy and suspense. His previous film, Under Silver Lake , was an unfairly overlooked commercial disappointment, but we thought it was an absolute keeper. As such, we’ve high hopes for Flowervale Street . Bring on the dinosaurs. The Hunger Games: Sunrise On The Reaping – 20th November Quentin Tarantino’s favourite killer contest franchise is back with another prequel, this one joining things up to the 2011 film that started it all. Hence why Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson are making a return as Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark. Expect more oppression, death and romance; Francis Lawrence has become a dab hand at making these. And as The Long Walk proved, he’s quite an underrated director, both technically and in the performances he gets from his actors. Dune: Part Three – 18th December An epic moment of epicness in Dune: Part Two. Credit: Warner Bros. The year ends with a pinch of spice courtesy of director Denis Villeneuve. Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya and the rest of the Dune crew are back for a third visit to Arrakis, and given that this chapter will sail beyond the confines of Frank Herbert’s original novel, which formed the basis for the first two movies, it’ll be fascinating to see where the Canadian filmmaker takes the saga next. Herbert’s own follow-up, Dune Messiah, had some truly wild ideas that might not translate too well onto a cinema screen, but Villeneuve’s previous adaptations were spectacularly done. Also coming up, with no release date attached: Ray Gunn, the animated sci-fi noir passion project from Brad Bird; Godzilla Minus Zero, the follow-up to instant kaiju klassic, Godzilla Minus One . You lucky, lucky people. /**/ Share this Article: ← Previous Podcast | Rocky IV (1985) and Rocky IV: Rocky Vs Drago – The Ultimate Director’s Cut (2021) Next → Rob Reiner | Filmmaker has died, at the age of 78 LATEST ISSUES Film Stories Issue 58!

Sign in to your CBR account Summary Generate a summary of this story follow Follow followed Followed Like Like Thread Log in Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents: Try something different: Show me the facts Explain it like I’m 5 Give me a lighthearted recap 2026 may be one of the best years for new sci-fi series ever. Next year already has several promising new science fiction shows lined up for premieres, any one of which could become the world's new obsession. Included among these is Neuromancer , an adaptation of a novel once thought to be \"unfilmable,\" but that is now finding new life on Apple TV+. Neuromancer isn't the only exciting sci-fi series set to premiere in 2026. Joining it on next year's docket are completely original shows from popular creators, spinoffs to franchises long thought dead, and intriguing expansions of universes just now reaching for the stars. There's plenty to love about next year's sci-fi offerings, and these shows top the list of new stories to look out for. Neuromancer Is the Riskiest Sci-Fi Series of the Decade Neuromancer book cover Image via Ace Books One of Apple TV+'s most exciting series of 2026 is Neuromancer , based on William Gibson's 1984 sci-fi novel of the same name. Neuromancer combines themes of dystopian literature, a sci-fi cyberpunk aesthetic, and a countercultural premise to create one distinctly unique story that has yet to be put to screen. The upcoming series features a phenomenal cast that includes Callum Turner, Mark Strong, Emma Laird, and Peter Sarsgaard. Neuromancer is an incredibly risky sci-fi series , with many studios having tried and failed to adapt the original novel to the big screen over the last several decades. Apple TV will be the first to successfully complete an adaptation, which will hopefully live up to fans' lofty expectations. If done right, Neuromancer could become the sci-fi event of the decade. Blade Runner 2099 Expands Ridley Scott's Underrated Sci-Fi World Humans hunt replicants in Blade Runner. Image via Warner Bros Blade Runner is finally coming back, nine years after the underrated Blade Runner 2049 flopped in theaters. This time, the cult classic franchise comes to the small screen in the form of Blade Runner 2099 , a miniseries set to premiere on Amazon Prime Video next year. Blade Runner 2099 will star Michelle Yeoh as the replicant Olwen, who contemplates mortality as her life seemingly approaches its bitter end. While Prime Video has revealed very little information about the upcoming spinoff, Blade Runner 2099 will borrow more from Ridley Scott's original Blade Runner than Denis Villeneuve's sequel. The series is the third and possibly final chance for Blade Runner to finally reach the wide audience it always needed to be a success. With an extended format and plenty of goodwill, Blade Runner 2099 could finally be the project that cracks the code for the franchise's success. Lanterns Expands James Gunn's DCU John Stewart and Hal Jordan walking down the street in civilian cothes from Lanterns-1 Image via DC Studios The next project on the docket for James Gunn's new DC Cinematic Universe (DCU) is Lanterns , an upcoming HBO Max series set to explore the inner workings of the Green Lantern Corps . The series, set to premiere sometime in 2026, will follow two Green Lanterns: Hal Jordan (Kyle Chandler), an older, more seasoned hero, and John Stewart (Aaron Pierre), who is just starting out as a member of the Corps. Together, they investigate a mysterious murder in a small town on Earth. Lanterns is especially exciting for comic book fans, who have waited decades for a proper live-action adaptation of the Green Lanterns from the DC universe. The series should also appeal to non-superhero fans, as it promises to explore fun science fiction themes and carve out a distinct corner for itself in the DCU. Shows like Lanterns always push the boundary on what television sci-fi can be, making this a can't-miss sci-fi event next year. Star Trek: Starfleet Academy Does Something New With the Classic Franchise The cadets at Starfleet Academy stand at attention Image via Paramount The universe of Star Trek is always expanding with new series that explore new corners of the final frontier. Now, Star Trek: Starfleet Academy takes the time to flesh out the very institution that created every hero the franchise has ever known. The upcoming spinoff takes place at the titular Starfleet Academy, where cadets train to become officers for the next generation of explorers. The new Star Trek series will premiere on January 15, 2026. With a promising cast that includes Holly Hunter, Tig Notaro, and Robert Picardo (returning as a hologram of The Doctor from Voyager ), Starfleet Academy has the chance to be the next great entry in the long-running sci-fi franchise. It focuses on an element of Star Trek lore that has yet to be fully fleshed out, giving fans something to look forward to as the mythos of their favorite fictional universe continues to expand. Doctor Who: The War Between the Land and the Sea Promises Big Things for Sci-Fi Fans Three sea devils stand at attention in Doctor Who: The War Between the Land and the Sea Image via BBC Although the future of Doctor Who itself remains in question following the show's recent separation from Disney+, at least one spinoff is still moving forward. The War Between the Land and the Sea is a long-gestating project from the mind of franchise superstar Russell T. Davies. The upcoming five-episode miniseries follows U.N.I.T. agents as they work to prevent a full-scale war from breaking out between humanity and the waterbound \"Sea Devils.\" As the first Doctor Who spinoff in almost a decade, The War Between the Land and the Sea is an important moment in the franchise's history. When Doctor Who rebooted itself several years ago, it came with the promise that its universe would expand in multiple new spinoffs. The War Between the Land and the Sea is the first peek at what Russell T. Davies has in store for the Doctor Who franchise, but still works as a standalone story with an intriguing premise that sci-fi enthusiasts won't want to miss. Star Wars: Maul — Shadow Lord Follows The Clone Wars' Best Villain Darth Maul ignites his double-bladed lightsaber in Star Wars: The Clone Wars Image via Lucasfilm/Everett Collection The next Star Wars animation project is an exciting spinoff entitled Maul: Shadow Lord . The upcoming series is a direct follow-up to the perennial fan-favorite, Star Wars: The Clone Wars , following Darth Maul's journey after the fall of the Republic. The series will fill in the gaps of Darth Maul's Star Wars story , revealing how he ends up on Malachor during the events of Star Wars: Rebels . Darth Maul is consistently one of the most intriguing characters in the Star Wars canon, always stealing the show when he shows up in series like The Clone Wars and Rebels . Now, the franchise finally gets to focus exclusively on his character, making this one of Lucasfilm's most exciting upcoming projects. Fans of science fiction should also be excited, as Shadow Lord will also explore the vast Star Wars galaxy as it succumbs to the tyrannical rule of the Empire. The Boroughs Is a New Sci-Fi Show From the Duffer Brothers Netflix / Courtesy Everett Collection Netflix's worldwide phenomenon, Stranger Things , finally ends later this year, but its creators are already hard at work making their next television series. The Duffer Brothers' next project, The Boroughs, takes place in a seemingly normal retirement community, where a band of aging heroes must work together to foil an alien threat. Netflix has revealed very little about The Boroughs besides its premise and a release window of 2026. However, knowing the Duffer Brothers' terrific storytelling technique, it is bound to be yet another hit. With a stacked cast led by Bill Pullman, Geena Davis, Alfred Molina, Clarke Peters, Alfre Woodard, and more, The Boroughs may be Netflix's most exciting release next year. Vision Quest Follows Up on the MCU's Best Television Show Paul Bettany's White Vision looking at Wanda from Wandavision Disney+/Marvel Studios / Courtesy Everett Collection Vision Quest is a new upcoming series that takes place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The series serves as a follow-up to WandaVision and Agatha All Along , two of the franchise's most highly rated Disney+ series ever. Vision Quest will follow Paul Bettany's synthezoid hero as he struggles to reclaim his memories and find meaning in life. While the MCU has been hit-or-miss with Disney+ series, Vision Quest has everything it needs to be one of the franchise's best shows yet. With a deep, psychological premise that feels fresh and new in the oversaturated superhero genre, the upcoming series could be one of the most deeply introspective entries in the entire MCU. Although there are still many mysteries surrounding Vision Quest and its place in the MCU , it could turn out to be a surprisingly terrific sci-fi series worth watching over and over again.

Sign in to your ScreenRant account Summary Generate a summary of this story follow Follow followed Followed Like Like Thread Log in Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents: Try something different: Show me the facts Explain it like I’m 5 Give me a lighthearted recap 2026 is scheduled to have a considerable range of monumentally exciting sci-fi movies released within it - though some of these films have more hype built up for them than others for at least the time being. Historically, sci-fi is a genre that can be explored in an astronomical assortment of ways - from gritty and grueling dystopian tales, to remarkably light-hearted romps through futuristic lands and concepts. The limitless possibilities of sci-fi stories go some way to explain why the genre also tends to consistently be one of the most popular and sought after when it comes to theatrically released films. Indeed, based on 2026's sci-fi movie lineup, it seems the year is set to be rife with criticial and commercial hits within this realm. Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die Sam Rockwell faces the camera in Good Luck Have Fun Don't Die While those lucky enough to attend the 2025 Fantastic Fest did garner an opportunity to watch a preview screening of sci-fi comedy Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die , the movie's full theatrical release is set to take place on February 13, 2026 , making it one of the first sci-fi films to release in the year. Based on Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die 's trailer - and strikingly solid 94% Rotten Tomatoes reviews from those who saw it early - it seems the film will be helping kick off the year in suitably stellar fashion. With a time travel premise that sees an unlucky inhabitant of a dystopian future journey back in time to try and save the world from its fate - recruiting a selection of seemingly random people from an LA diner in the hopes of creating a team that can protect humanity - it's clear Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die will be as entertaining as it is visually striking, making it an early must-watch for 2026. Flowervale Street Flowervale Street poster The mystery around Flowervale Street has worked in its favor in some ways when it comes to building hype around it from those who are aware of its existence. However, the relative lack of information we have about the movie does mean the main excitement around the film comes from the names that are currently attached to it, which include J.J. Abrams being one of the film's producers, and Anne Hathaway and Ewan McGregor being some of the main actors involved. Thus far, what's been teased for Flowervale Street seems to promise an exciting story, complete with at least one dinosaur and a street that's being affected by sci-fi phenomena, altering the lives of lead characters the Platt family forever - though more specifics about this installment will seemingly only become clearer closer to its scheduled August 14 release date . The Dog Stars The Dog Stars book cover Ridley Scott's history in the sci-fi genre is impossible to miss, with the likes of Alien , Blade Runner , and later The Martian cementing his reputation as someone who is able to give futuristic worlds and larger-than-life stories a grounded edge that makes them truly gripping throughout. As such, it's no surprise Scott's next sci-fi film, The Dog Stars , is one many are very excited to see release on March 27 . This is doubly true given the movie is adapting a book of the same name, which promises a suitably soulful and dramatic story of a man, his dog, and the gunman they befriended existing in a post-apocalyptic world, before one radio transmission sends the protagonists on an unexpected mission. Steven Spielberg's 2026 Movie Steven Spielberg at the London Premiere of The Thursday Murder Club John Rainford/Cover Images With Steven Spielberg being one of the biggest names in the directing sphere still decades into his career, his impending 2026 sci-fi release is naturally one that has a lot of intrigue and excitement around it - particularly since it appears details about the film may be being kept secret for as long as possible, given the name of the movie still isn't known, though its release is schedule for only months away on June 12, 2026 . Set to feature a range of talented actors - including Colman Domingo, Wyatt Russell, Emily Blunt and Colin Firth - Steven Spielberg's movie is reportedly based on an original idea from the director, and will be the first movie he's directed to hit cinemas since 2022's The Fabelmans . As such, there seems to be plenty of reasons to be excited about the film, even if we know little other than the fact it doesn't seem Steven Spielberg's sci-fi film is set to play in IMAX in 2026. Project Hail Mary Ryan Gosling in Project Hail Mary Combining a sci-fi story that is in many ways inherently suited to a big-screen adaptation - as is the case for Andy Weir's 2021 book Project Hail Mary - and some talented actors and directors seems a recipe built for success. As such, it's worth noting that Project Hail Mary is directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller - who may be most recognizable as the directors of the Spider-Verse films - and has Ryan Gosling play the movie's lead character, which all seems to suggest the film could well become one of the bigger movies of 2026 when it releases on March 20 . Project Hail Mary centers around Ryland Grace, a scientist whose primary challenge in the story comes when he finds himself on a space mission with no memory of who he is or what he was striving to do. Grace soon encounters an alien lifeform who becomes his main companion in this complex set of circumstances, with their dynamic unfolding into a truly emotional story about two very different worlds. Hunger Games: Sunrise On The Reaping The Hunger Games has seen a resurgence in popularity thanks to 2023's The Hunger Games: A Ballad Of Songbirds And Snakes , which itself built hype for fellow Hunger Games prequel Hunger Games: Sunrise On The Reaping - a film that is set to release on November 20, 2026 . Sunrise On The Reaping covers the story of Katniss' mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, and what his first Hunger Games was like - with the original books and movies providing some details regarding this matter, but leaving much of the 50th annual Hunger Games otherwise a mystery. Hunger Games: Sunrise On The Reaping 's trailer has already demonstrated how the film will balance the action and tragedies that make the series so gripping, while also delving further into the history of both Haymitch himself, and the world of Panem, shedding more light on the events of the main timeline. Supergirl Milly Alcock as Supergirl in the Superman movie While there have been a fair number of live-action DC movies over the years, the films often veer away from showing the further reaches of the comic universe, instead focusing more squarely on Earth and the events that take place on it. This makes it all the more exciting that Supergirl seems set to do just the opposite with its story, since it looks to adapt the comic run of Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, which takes place almost entirely on a range of different alien planets that are much unlike our own in many ways. Not only does this ensure Supergirl gets a more directly sci-fi-esque story - unlike Kal-El's adventures in the DCU's first movie, Superman - it also means the DC Universe's further corners can be fleshed out as early as its second film thanks to Supergirl 's June 26, 2026 release date , which has major implications for the wider franchise, too. Dune 3 Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides in Dune 2 looking off-screen Sci-fi's favorite alien worm series is set to return once more with the movie reboot's third installment, which is scheduled to debut on December 18, 2026 , and take viewers back to the world of Arrakis as Paul Atreides tries to unite its people to fight against the threat of House Harkonnen, who seek to take over the planet and its valuable resources. Now the first two installments of this series have built up a solid audience for the films and their epic story of how the cosmos are changed by the family of House Atreides forever, it seems the third film has a prime opportunity to delve into some of the biggest events in the book series - and introduce some of the bigger moral questions and plot twists that the story has to offer. Thus far, the 2020s Dune series has done a striking job of translating the sprawling sci-fi worlds of the books to life - both in its visuals and in the acting of its cast of characters - and it seems things are likely to only continue to amp up in this vital chapter of the story in every regard, painting a decidedly thrilling picture of what's to come for the franchise. The Mandalorian And Grogu Grogu eating cookies in The Mandalorian Mentioning there's hype for an upcoming Star Wars movie is perhaps as obvious as saying water is wet, even though the decades-old sci-fi world has seen some more divided reception in the past few years - which naturally bodes well for The Mandalorian and Grogu when it releases on May 22, 2026 . The Mandalorian and Grogu focusing on two of the most beloved new characters from the franchise's recent years should go some way to convince even those who have not been as keen on Star Wars' newer directions to give the film a chance, which suggests the already staggering brand appeal at play here can be capitalized on even further. With the opportunity to be a space-faring action-packed adventure, a follow-up on the aftermath of some of the biggest events in Star Wars' timeline, and a tale of an unusual found family finding their place in the galaxy, Din Djarin and Grogu's film story should theoretically have a little of something for every kind of Star Wars fan, and then some. Avengers: Doomsday Fantastic Four First Steps Post-Credits scene of Franklin Richards and Doctor Doom The sheer scope and scale teased for Avengers: Doomsday means it's inherently the biggest sci-fi movie of 2026 in terms of hype, even though the MCU has, much like Star Wars, had some more divided reception in recent months and years. The MCU has grown bigger and bigger over the course of its almost two-decade-long run, both in terms of the size of its world and stories, and in terms of its reputation. Doomsday will be the first Avengers movie since the genre-defining success of Avengers: Endgame - which sets a high bar for film in terms of what is possible for it when it releases on December 18, 2026 , but also ensures that a monumental amount of people are eagerly awaiting what this next chapter of the Avengers series holds, even if some may have their doubts about what might come next. With this next part of the MCU bringing back several major figures for the franchise - including many big Fox X-Men actors, and of course the return of Robert Downey Jr, this time playing Doctor Doom - the stage is set for a truly colossal story that pays tribute to not just every part of the MCU that came before it, but also to the wider Marvel movie world, thanks to the franchise's recent sci-fi forays into the concept of the multiverse.

And all this sets our\nsights high for the coming year. Lucky, then, the studios and directors we\nhave given our time and money to will be delivering exactly what we want. Steven Spielberg returns to the broader genre for the first time\nsince 2018’s Ready Player One, and to alien films specifically since 2008’s\nIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Ridley Scott is also\ndusting off his lenses for an adaptation of Peter Heller’s The Dog Stars. Marvel fans who have felt let down by the middling films the\nsuperhero giant has put out this decade have a new Spider-Man and Avengers\nto look forward to, and DC die-hards get to see Supergirl finally take the\nlimelight on screen again after decades spent MIA. Other big franchises getting another chance to shine include\nThe Hunger Games, Mortal Kombat, and The Mandalorian (in its silver screen\ndebut), but there is also plenty for the indie crowd, with Maggie Gyllenhaal’s gangster\nmonster movie The Bride!, and Na Hong-jin’s alien thriller Hope - his first multinational\nfeature. It’s a full roster, and suffice to say, the following 20 movies are certain to become your most anticipated sci-fi films of 2026, if they’re not\nalready. 20. The Dresden Sun VMI Worldwide UK release date: February (day TBC) Science fiction fans who are hoping The Dresden Sun might be\nan adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse 5 will be sorely disappointed\n(our day will come!), but for everyone else, Michael Ryan’s upcoming picture\npromises an exciting new entry in a rather niche genre: the sci-fi heist\nmovie. The film features converging narratives which see an expert mercenary\nwork an inside job to steal a big corporation’s most valued asset, while an\ninsurance analyst is caught in a web of corporate rivals and fraud, ending up\non the run from a military contractor. The first look trailer and those few\nimages available of The Dresden Sun so far suggest a high-tech, neon, Blade Runner\naesthetic paired with a modern corporate espionage crime thriller’s steely\nedge. It definitely doesn’t have anything like the budget of many\nof the other sci-fi flicks heading our way next year, but it’s got an\nintriguing cast in Christina Ricci, Steven Ogg (Trevor from GTA V), and Mena\nSuvari, and looks like it’s going to be a solid streaming watch.

And 2026 is positively stuffed with genre films from some of the world’s most respected filmmakers: the last time we had Steven Spielberg and Ridley Scott release a sci-fi movie in the same year was in 1982. With apologies to any superhero movies that might happen to contain sci-fi elements (no Supergirl or Avengers: Doomsday here), please enjoy this list of the most exciting genre films coming up next year. Big budgets, small budgets, comedy elements, splashes of horror – there really is something for just about everyone in the list below. Let’s begin, then, with a cautionary tale about indulging in carnal relations with a household appliance… Soulm8te – 9th January (or perhaps not…) A shot from M3GAN 2.0. No official imagery available for Soulm8te at the time of writing, readers. Credit: Universal The year gets off to a rather saucy start with this spin-off from Blumhouse’s killer robot thriller, M3GAN. Soulm8te is said to be taking the franchise into erotic territory, as a lonely widower buys a gynoid to keep him company – only for the wretched thing to start wreaking havoc. Directed by Kate Dolan and starring David Rysdahl and Lily Sullivan, it sounds like similar territory to Subservience , a 2024 thriller starring Megan Fox, and numerous other films where human-robot relations turn sour. Will it be a bigger hit than M3GAN 2.0 , which was an unexpected disappointment in 2025? Dunno m8. (Since this post was written, Universal has reportedly taken Soulm8te off its 2026 calendar, and is now shopping it to other distributors. We haven’t seen any official confirmation of this as yet, but we’ll update this list if we do.) Bulk – January and February Noah Taylor on restrained form in Bulk. Credit: Film Four. British director Ben Wheatley’s career has spanned indie drama and horror ( Down Terrace, Kill List ) and expensive thrillers ( Rebecca, Meg 2: The Trench ). Bulk sees the filmmaker explore mind-bending science fiction, albeit in a uniquely DIY fashion. Shot on a tiny budget on domestic cameras (iPhones, SVHS and the like), Bulk sees protagonist Corey Harlan (Sam Riley) head off into a bizarre, dimension-spanning odyssey that includes an enigmatic scientist (Alexandra Maria Lara) and a variety of eccentric characters played by Noah Taylor. That Harlan’s odyssey takes place almost entirely in a single nondescript house doesn’t make it any less epic. Touring UK cinemas large and small in early 2026 , Bulk is possibly the most mesmerising, unusual genre films you’ll see all year. You certainly won’t forget it in a hurry. 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple – 14th January Ralph Fiennes holds his temple in 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple. Credit: Sony. Director Nia DaCosta takes over from Danny Boyle for the next chapter in a planned 28 Years trilogy, and by all accounts, this one’s an absolute corker. Picking up the thread from 2025’s sequel, it’s another journey into a country riven by superstition, disease and territorialism. We do wonder where screenwriter Alex Garland gets his out-there ideas from. Mercy – 23rd January We’ll try to go into this one with an open mind. It’s the latest film from director Timur Bekmambetov, previously known for the flashy action thriller, Wanted , but more recently associated with a series of ‘screenlife’ thrillers. He was producer on War Of The Worlds – a version of HG Wells’ invasion text viewed entirely through a computer interface. Starring Ice Cube and a supporting cast of Amazon goods and services, it was one of the most bafflingly misguided films of 2025 . But anyway: Mercy . Starring Chris Pratt, it’s set in a Minority Report -esque future where the entire legal system has been handed over to AI. Chris Pratt plays a detective who’s accused of murdering his own wife, and has 90 minutes to convince an icy digital judge (Rebecca Ferguson) of his innocence – or face summary execution. The perplexing thing about Mercy isn’t so much the premise as the venue; Amazon MGM’s giving it a big cinema push, including a run on 3D IMAX screens. The trailer dresses the film up a bit, but it’s still mostly a single-location thriller with plot points unfolding on computer screens. We’re not sure it screams big-screen, bring-your-chums entertainment – but again, we’ll keep an open mind. Suggested product Nicolas Cage Appreciation Coasters Merch £12.99 Suggested product Film Stories \"I Try Not To Do Snark...\" Tee Merch £22.99 Cold Storage – 13th February 2026 The Last Of Us played for laughs? Quite possibly. A storage facility becomes overrun by a mind-controlling fungus in a sci-fi comedy written by David Koepp – adapted from his own novel – and directed by Jonny Campbell ( Alien Autopsy ). Georgina Campbell ( Barbarian ) and Joe Keery ( Stranger Things ) star, and there’s a role too for Liam Neeson, who’s made some, er, interesting career choices of late. That’s hardly the film’s fault, though. The trailer is filled with gore and sweary, gross-out humour, and it all looks tremendously entertaining. Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die – 20th February Another sci-fi comedy, Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die marks the return of director Gore Verbinski ( Rango , the Pirates Of The Caribbean franchise). Sam Rockwell stars as a dishevelled, oddly-dressed man who stumbles into a diner one night insisting that he’s from the future – and that he needs the customers’ help to avert a future war against machines. The film made its debut at 2025’s Fantastic Fest, where it garnered almost universally positive reviews. The supporting cast includes Zazie Beetz, Michael Pena and Juno Temple. We can’t wait. In The Blink Of An Eye – 27th February We were a bit worried about this film for a while. Finished in March 2025 , In The Blink Of An Eye sat without a release date for several months, with rumours of reshoots doing the rounds. The sci-fi drama is now making its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, meaning it’ll screen there between late January and the 1st February. From Wall-E and John Carter director Andrew Stanton, In The Blink Of An Eye is an epoch-spanning fable that takes us from humanity’s earliest days to a spacecraft 200 years in the future. The script, by Colby Day, was on the Black List of best unproduced screenplays in 2016, and it’s a terrific read : seamlessly eliding between eras and characters at various points in history, all building to a truly emotional climax. Day also wrote Spaceman, an Adam Sandler sci-fi you can find on Netflix; In The Blink Of An Eye promises to be another terrific genre piece. (Unfortunately, In The Blink Of An Eye doesn’t appear to be getting a cinema release after its festival debut; instead, Disney has opted to send it directly to its Hulu screening service on the 27th February.) The Bride! – 26th March Not connected to Guillermo del Toro’s baroque take on Frankenstein made for Netflix, The Bride is the latest film from actor turned director Maggie Gyllenhaal. It stars Jessie Buckley as a mortally injured woman revived by Anette Bening’s Dr Euphronius, while Christian Bale plays the monster and the Bride’s betrothed. Moving Mary Shelley’s Gothic novel into the roaring (19)20s, it looks like a sumptuous and beautifully-designed tragic romance. Project Hail Mary – 20th March Based on the novel by Andy Weir, Project Hail Mary sees Ryan Gosling’s unassuming science teacher blasted into space in a last-ditch effort to save humanity. The trailer gave away a bit more of the book’s events than we were expecting, so maybe avoid that if you want to go into the cinema completely cold. The adaptation’s by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, so expect plenty of humour and heart as well as Weir’s plausibly detailed science fiction. In a case of unfortunate cosmic timing, Project Hail Mary places it rather near another major sci-fi film from a director whose last big hit was also a Weir adaptation… The Dog Stars – 27th March There aren’t any images for The Dog Stars kicking around yet, so please accept this still from 1980s children’s TV show, Children Of The Dog Star. We used to quite like it. Some of Ridley Scott’s most beloved and influential movies are in the sci-fi genre – Alien, Blade Runner and The Martian (the Weir adaptation we were on about above) are all markedly different in tone, but all classics in their own way. We’re excited to see what Scott’s done with The Dog Stars, then: adapted from Peter Heller’s novel, it’s set in a future world ravaged by a pandemic. Holed up in an aircraft hangar, the two protagonists – Jacog Elordi’s pilot, Hig and Josh Brolin’s sniper, Bangley – are coaxed back into the open world by a mysterious signal. Margaret Qualley, Guy Pearce and Benedict Wong also star. Given Scott’s visual flair – even his uneven Alien prequels were often lovely to look at – this is arguably one of our most anticipated genre films of the year. The Mandalorian And Grogu – 22nd May Lucasfilm’s first Star Wars movie in seven years, The Mandalorian And Grogu takes the hit Disney+ series out for a big screen spin-off – making it the Holiday On The Buses of space fantasies. We don’t know much about the plot, and frankly, we don’t need to know: as long as director Jon Favreau delivers on the pace and spectacle, we should be in for a pulpy, entertaining evening at the pictures. Pedro Pascal, Grogu, Sigourney Weaver and Jeremy Allan White all star – the latter as the alarmingly buff son of the late Jabba. Disclosure Day – 12th June It’s an absurdly stuffed year for respected directors making genre films. And Disclosure Day could be the biggest of the lot: it’s the latest from Steven Spielberg, and a return to the UFO-based subject matter of Close Encounters Of The Third Kind. It’s written by David Koepp (see Cold Storage earlier), who previously worked with Spielberg on the adapted screenplay for Jurassic Park, and following the autobiographical drama of The Fabelmans , it’s a return to the summer blockbuster experience the filmmaker essentially invented. Emily Blunt, Josh O’Connor and Wyatt Russell star; it’s about an attempt to reveal the truth about alien intelligence to the world, and a shadowy attempt to stop it. We think. The trailer’s big on intrigue and low on plot specifics. It compels us, though. Flowervale Street – 10th August A generic picture of a dinosaur, courtesy of Public Domain Pictures. It Follows was one of the great horror movies of the 2010s, and here comes its director, David Robert Mitchell, with some sort of time-travelling IMAX thriller involving dinosaurs. Ewen McGregor and Anne Hathaway are the starriest names among the warm-blooded cast. At present, we don’t know a whole lot more about this one, either, but Mitchell is a hugely talented director of both comedy and suspense. His previous film, Under Silver Lake , was an unfairly overlooked commercial disappointment, but we thought it was an absolute keeper. As such, we’ve high hopes for Flowervale Street . Bring on the dinosaurs. The Hunger Games: Sunrise On The Reaping – 20th November Quentin Tarantino’s favourite killer contest franchise is back with another prequel, this one joining things up to the 2011 film that started it all. Hence why Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson are making a return as Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark. Expect more oppression, death and romance; Francis Lawrence has become a dab hand at making these. And as The Long Walk proved, he’s quite an underrated director, both technically and in the performances he gets from his actors. Dune: Part Three – 18th December An epic moment of epicness in Dune: Part Two. Credit: Warner Bros. The year ends with a pinch of spice courtesy of director Denis Villeneuve. Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya and the rest of the Dune crew are back for a third visit to Arrakis, and given that this chapter will sail beyond the confines of Frank Herbert’s original novel, which formed the basis for the first two movies, it’ll be fascinating to see where the Canadian filmmaker takes the saga next. Herbert’s own follow-up, Dune Messiah, had some truly wild ideas that might not translate too well onto a cinema screen, but Villeneuve’s previous adaptations were spectacularly done. Also coming up, with no release date attached: Ray Gunn, the animated sci-fi noir passion project from Brad Bird; Godzilla Minus Zero, the follow-up to instant kaiju klassic, Godzilla Minus One . You lucky, lucky people. /**/ Share this Article: ← Previous Podcast | Rocky IV (1985) and Rocky IV: Rocky Vs Drago – The Ultimate Director’s Cut (2021) Next → Rob Reiner | Filmmaker has died, at the age of 78 LATEST ISSUES Film Stories Issue 58!

Sign in to your ScreenRant account Summary Generate a summary of this story follow Follow followed Followed Like Like Thread Log in Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents: Try something different: Show me the facts Explain it like I’m 5 Give me a lighthearted recap 2026 is scheduled to have a considerable range of monumentally exciting sci-fi movies released within it - though some of these films have more hype built up for them than others for at least the time being. Historically, sci-fi is a genre that can be explored in an astronomical assortment of ways - from gritty and grueling dystopian tales, to remarkably light-hearted romps through futuristic lands and concepts. The limitless possibilities of sci-fi stories go some way to explain why the genre also tends to consistently be one of the most popular and sought after when it comes to theatrically released films. Indeed, based on 2026's sci-fi movie lineup, it seems the year is set to be rife with criticial and commercial hits within this realm. Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die Sam Rockwell faces the camera in Good Luck Have Fun Don't Die While those lucky enough to attend the 2025 Fantastic Fest did garner an opportunity to watch a preview screening of sci-fi comedy Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die , the movie's full theatrical release is set to take place on February 13, 2026 , making it one of the first sci-fi films to release in the year. Based on Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die 's trailer - and strikingly solid 94% Rotten Tomatoes reviews from those who saw it early - it seems the film will be helping kick off the year in suitably stellar fashion. With a time travel premise that sees an unlucky inhabitant of a dystopian future journey back in time to try and save the world from its fate - recruiting a selection of seemingly random people from an LA diner in the hopes of creating a team that can protect humanity - it's clear Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die will be as entertaining as it is visually striking, making it an early must-watch for 2026. Flowervale Street Flowervale Street poster The mystery around Flowervale Street has worked in its favor in some ways when it comes to building hype around it from those who are aware of its existence. However, the relative lack of information we have about the movie does mean the main excitement around the film comes from the names that are currently attached to it, which include J.J. Abrams being one of the film's producers, and Anne Hathaway and Ewan McGregor being some of the main actors involved. Thus far, what's been teased for Flowervale Street seems to promise an exciting story, complete with at least one dinosaur and a street that's being affected by sci-fi phenomena, altering the lives of lead characters the Platt family forever - though more specifics about this installment will seemingly only become clearer closer to its scheduled August 14 release date . The Dog Stars The Dog Stars book cover Ridley Scott's history in the sci-fi genre is impossible to miss, with the likes of Alien , Blade Runner , and later The Martian cementing his reputation as someone who is able to give futuristic worlds and larger-than-life stories a grounded edge that makes them truly gripping throughout. As such, it's no surprise Scott's next sci-fi film, The Dog Stars , is one many are very excited to see release on March 27 . This is doubly true given the movie is adapting a book of the same name, which promises a suitably soulful and dramatic story of a man, his dog, and the gunman they befriended existing in a post-apocalyptic world, before one radio transmission sends the protagonists on an unexpected mission. Steven Spielberg's 2026 Movie Steven Spielberg at the London Premiere of The Thursday Murder Club John Rainford/Cover Images With Steven Spielberg being one of the biggest names in the directing sphere still decades into his career, his impending 2026 sci-fi release is naturally one that has a lot of intrigue and excitement around it - particularly since it appears details about the film may be being kept secret for as long as possible, given the name of the movie still isn't known, though its release is schedule for only months away on June 12, 2026 . Set to feature a range of talented actors - including Colman Domingo, Wyatt Russell, Emily Blunt and Colin Firth - Steven Spielberg's movie is reportedly based on an original idea from the director, and will be the first movie he's directed to hit cinemas since 2022's The Fabelmans . As such, there seems to be plenty of reasons to be excited about the film, even if we know little other than the fact it doesn't seem Steven Spielberg's sci-fi film is set to play in IMAX in 2026. Project Hail Mary Ryan Gosling in Project Hail Mary Combining a sci-fi story that is in many ways inherently suited to a big-screen adaptation - as is the case for Andy Weir's 2021 book Project Hail Mary - and some talented actors and directors seems a recipe built for success. As such, it's worth noting that Project Hail Mary is directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller - who may be most recognizable as the directors of the Spider-Verse films - and has Ryan Gosling play the movie's lead character, which all seems to suggest the film could well become one of the bigger movies of 2026 when it releases on March 20 . Project Hail Mary centers around Ryland Grace, a scientist whose primary challenge in the story comes when he finds himself on a space mission with no memory of who he is or what he was striving to do. Grace soon encounters an alien lifeform who becomes his main companion in this complex set of circumstances, with their dynamic unfolding into a truly emotional story about two very different worlds. Hunger Games: Sunrise On The Reaping The Hunger Games has seen a resurgence in popularity thanks to 2023's The Hunger Games: A Ballad Of Songbirds And Snakes , which itself built hype for fellow Hunger Games prequel Hunger Games: Sunrise On The Reaping - a film that is set to release on November 20, 2026 . Sunrise On The Reaping covers the story of Katniss' mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, and what his first Hunger Games was like - with the original books and movies providing some details regarding this matter, but leaving much of the 50th annual Hunger Games otherwise a mystery. Hunger Games: Sunrise On The Reaping 's trailer has already demonstrated how the film will balance the action and tragedies that make the series so gripping, while also delving further into the history of both Haymitch himself, and the world of Panem, shedding more light on the events of the main timeline. Supergirl Milly Alcock as Supergirl in the Superman movie While there have been a fair number of live-action DC movies over the years, the films often veer away from showing the further reaches of the comic universe, instead focusing more squarely on Earth and the events that take place on it. This makes it all the more exciting that Supergirl seems set to do just the opposite with its story, since it looks to adapt the comic run of Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, which takes place almost entirely on a range of different alien planets that are much unlike our own in many ways. Not only does this ensure Supergirl gets a more directly sci-fi-esque story - unlike Kal-El's adventures in the DCU's first movie, Superman - it also means the DC Universe's further corners can be fleshed out as early as its second film thanks to Supergirl 's June 26, 2026 release date , which has major implications for the wider franchise, too. Dune 3 Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides in Dune 2 looking off-screen Sci-fi's favorite alien worm series is set to return once more with the movie reboot's third installment, which is scheduled to debut on December 18, 2026 , and take viewers back to the world of Arrakis as Paul Atreides tries to unite its people to fight against the threat of House Harkonnen, who seek to take over the planet and its valuable resources. Now the first two installments of this series have built up a solid audience for the films and their epic story of how the cosmos are changed by the family of House Atreides forever, it seems the third film has a prime opportunity to delve into some of the biggest events in the book series - and introduce some of the bigger moral questions and plot twists that the story has to offer. Thus far, the 2020s Dune series has done a striking job of translating the sprawling sci-fi worlds of the books to life - both in its visuals and in the acting of its cast of characters - and it seems things are likely to only continue to amp up in this vital chapter of the story in every regard, painting a decidedly thrilling picture of what's to come for the franchise. The Mandalorian And Grogu Grogu eating cookies in The Mandalorian Mentioning there's hype for an upcoming Star Wars movie is perhaps as obvious as saying water is wet, even though the decades-old sci-fi world has seen some more divided reception in the past few years - which naturally bodes well for The Mandalorian and Grogu when it releases on May 22, 2026 . The Mandalorian and Grogu focusing on two of the most beloved new characters from the franchise's recent years should go some way to convince even those who have not been as keen on Star Wars' newer directions to give the film a chance, which suggests the already staggering brand appeal at play here can be capitalized on even further. With the opportunity to be a space-faring action-packed adventure, a follow-up on the aftermath of some of the biggest events in Star Wars' timeline, and a tale of an unusual found family finding their place in the galaxy, Din Djarin and Grogu's film story should theoretically have a little of something for every kind of Star Wars fan, and then some. Avengers: Doomsday Fantastic Four First Steps Post-Credits scene of Franklin Richards and Doctor Doom The sheer scope and scale teased for Avengers: Doomsday means it's inherently the biggest sci-fi movie of 2026 in terms of hype, even though the MCU has, much like Star Wars, had some more divided reception in recent months and years. The MCU has grown bigger and bigger over the course of its almost two-decade-long run, both in terms of the size of its world and stories, and in terms of its reputation. Doomsday will be the first Avengers movie since the genre-defining success of Avengers: Endgame - which sets a high bar for film in terms of what is possible for it when it releases on December 18, 2026 , but also ensures that a monumental amount of people are eagerly awaiting what this next chapter of the Avengers series holds, even if some may have their doubts about what might come next. With this next part of the MCU bringing back several major figures for the franchise - including many big Fox X-Men actors, and of course the return of Robert Downey Jr, this time playing Doctor Doom - the stage is set for a truly colossal story that pays tribute to not just every part of the MCU that came before it, but also to the wider Marvel movie world, thanks to the franchise's recent sci-fi forays into the concept of the multiverse.

And all this sets our\nsights high for the coming year. Lucky, then, the studios and directors we\nhave given our time and money to will be delivering exactly what we want. Steven Spielberg returns to the broader genre for the first time\nsince 2018’s Ready Player One, and to alien films specifically since 2008’s\nIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Ridley Scott is also\ndusting off his lenses for an adaptation of Peter Heller’s The Dog Stars. Marvel fans who have felt let down by the middling films the\nsuperhero giant has put out this decade have a new Spider-Man and Avengers\nto look forward to, and DC die-hards get to see Supergirl finally take the\nlimelight on screen again after decades spent MIA. Other big franchises getting another chance to shine include\nThe Hunger Games, Mortal Kombat, and The Mandalorian (in its silver screen\ndebut), but there is also plenty for the indie crowd, with Maggie Gyllenhaal’s gangster\nmonster movie The Bride!, and Na Hong-jin’s alien thriller Hope - his first multinational\nfeature. It’s a full roster, and suffice to say, the following 20 movies are certain to become your most anticipated sci-fi films of 2026, if they’re not\nalready. 20. The Dresden Sun VMI Worldwide UK release date: February (day TBC) Science fiction fans who are hoping The Dresden Sun might be\nan adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse 5 will be sorely disappointed\n(our day will come!), but for everyone else, Michael Ryan’s upcoming picture\npromises an exciting new entry in a rather niche genre: the sci-fi heist\nmovie. The film features converging narratives which see an expert mercenary\nwork an inside job to steal a big corporation’s most valued asset, while an\ninsurance analyst is caught in a web of corporate rivals and fraud, ending up\non the run from a military contractor. The first look trailer and those few\nimages available of The Dresden Sun so far suggest a high-tech, neon, Blade Runner\naesthetic paired with a modern corporate espionage crime thriller’s steely\nedge. It definitely doesn’t have anything like the budget of many\nof the other sci-fi flicks heading our way next year, but it’s got an\nintriguing cast in Christina Ricci, Steven Ogg (Trevor from GTA V), and Mena\nSuvari, and looks like it’s going to be a solid streaming watch.

And 2026 is positively stuffed with genre films from some of the world’s most respected filmmakers: the last time we had Steven Spielberg and Ridley Scott release a sci-fi movie in the same year was in 1982. With apologies to any superhero movies that might happen to contain sci-fi elements (no Supergirl or Avengers: Doomsday here), please enjoy this list of the most exciting genre films coming up next year. Big budgets, small budgets, comedy elements, splashes of horror – there really is something for just about everyone in the list below. Let’s begin, then, with a cautionary tale about indulging in carnal relations with a household appliance… Soulm8te – 9th January (or perhaps not…) A shot from M3GAN 2.0. No official imagery available for Soulm8te at the time of writing, readers. Credit: Universal The year gets off to a rather saucy start with this spin-off from Blumhouse’s killer robot thriller, M3GAN. Soulm8te is said to be taking the franchise into erotic territory, as a lonely widower buys a gynoid to keep him company – only for the wretched thing to start wreaking havoc. Directed by Kate Dolan and starring David Rysdahl and Lily Sullivan, it sounds like similar territory to Subservience , a 2024 thriller starring Megan Fox, and numerous other films where human-robot relations turn sour. Will it be a bigger hit than M3GAN 2.0 , which was an unexpected disappointment in 2025? Dunno m8. (Since this post was written, Universal has reportedly taken Soulm8te off its 2026 calendar, and is now shopping it to other distributors. We haven’t seen any official confirmation of this as yet, but we’ll update this list if we do.) Bulk – January and February Noah Taylor on restrained form in Bulk. Credit: Film Four. British director Ben Wheatley’s career has spanned indie drama and horror ( Down Terrace, Kill List ) and expensive thrillers ( Rebecca, Meg 2: The Trench ). Bulk sees the filmmaker explore mind-bending science fiction, albeit in a uniquely DIY fashion. Shot on a tiny budget on domestic cameras (iPhones, SVHS and the like), Bulk sees protagonist Corey Harlan (Sam Riley) head off into a bizarre, dimension-spanning odyssey that includes an enigmatic scientist (Alexandra Maria Lara) and a variety of eccentric characters played by Noah Taylor. That Harlan’s odyssey takes place almost entirely in a single nondescript house doesn’t make it any less epic. Touring UK cinemas large and small in early 2026 , Bulk is possibly the most mesmerising, unusual genre films you’ll see all year. You certainly won’t forget it in a hurry. 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple – 14th January Ralph Fiennes holds his temple in 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple. Credit: Sony. Director Nia DaCosta takes over from Danny Boyle for the next chapter in a planned 28 Years trilogy, and by all accounts, this one’s an absolute corker. Picking up the thread from 2025’s sequel, it’s another journey into a country riven by superstition, disease and territorialism. We do wonder where screenwriter Alex Garland gets his out-there ideas from. Mercy – 23rd January We’ll try to go into this one with an open mind. It’s the latest film from director Timur Bekmambetov, previously known for the flashy action thriller, Wanted , but more recently associated with a series of ‘screenlife’ thrillers. He was producer on War Of The Worlds – a version of HG Wells’ invasion text viewed entirely through a computer interface. Starring Ice Cube and a supporting cast of Amazon goods and services, it was one of the most bafflingly misguided films of 2025 . But anyway: Mercy . Starring Chris Pratt, it’s set in a Minority Report -esque future where the entire legal system has been handed over to AI. Chris Pratt plays a detective who’s accused of murdering his own wife, and has 90 minutes to convince an icy digital judge (Rebecca Ferguson) of his innocence – or face summary execution. The perplexing thing about Mercy isn’t so much the premise as the venue; Amazon MGM’s giving it a big cinema push, including a run on 3D IMAX screens. The trailer dresses the film up a bit, but it’s still mostly a single-location thriller with plot points unfolding on computer screens. We’re not sure it screams big-screen, bring-your-chums entertainment – but again, we’ll keep an open mind. Suggested product 'Worst Timeline' Mug Merch £10.99 Suggested product Issue #55 (Deep Cover): Print Magazine Magazine £6.99 Cold Storage – 13th February 2026 The Last Of Us played for laughs? Quite possibly. A storage facility becomes overrun by a mind-controlling fungus in a sci-fi comedy written by David Koepp – adapted from his own novel – and directed by Jonny Campbell ( Alien Autopsy ). Georgina Campbell ( Barbarian ) and Joe Keery ( Stranger Things ) star, and there’s a role too for Liam Neeson, who’s made some, er, interesting career choices of late. That’s hardly the film’s fault, though. The trailer is filled with gore and sweary, gross-out humour, and it all looks tremendously entertaining. Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die – 20th February Another sci-fi comedy, Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die marks the return of director Gore Verbinski ( Rango , the Pirates Of The Caribbean franchise). Sam Rockwell stars as a dishevelled, oddly-dressed man who stumbles into a diner one night insisting that he’s from the future – and that he needs the customers’ help to avert a future war against machines. The film made its debut at 2025’s Fantastic Fest, where it garnered almost universally positive reviews. The supporting cast includes Zazie Beetz, Michael Pena and Juno Temple. We can’t wait. In The Blink Of An Eye – 27th February We were a bit worried about this film for a while. Finished in March 2025 , In The Blink Of An Eye sat without a release date for several months, with rumours of reshoots doing the rounds. The sci-fi drama is now making its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, meaning it’ll screen there between late January and the 1st February. From Wall-E and John Carter director Andrew Stanton, In The Blink Of An Eye is an epoch-spanning fable that takes us from humanity’s earliest days to a spacecraft 200 years in the future. The script, by Colby Day, was on the Black List of best unproduced screenplays in 2016, and it’s a terrific read : seamlessly eliding between eras and characters at various points in history, all building to a truly emotional climax. Day also wrote Spaceman, an Adam Sandler sci-fi you can find on Netflix; In The Blink Of An Eye promises to be another terrific genre piece. (Unfortunately, In The Blink Of An Eye doesn’t appear to be getting a cinema release after its festival debut; instead, Disney has opted to send it directly to its Hulu screening service on the 27th February.) The Bride! – 26th March Not connected to Guillermo del Toro’s baroque take on Frankenstein made for Netflix, The Bride is the latest film from actor turned director Maggie Gyllenhaal. It stars Jessie Buckley as a mortally injured woman revived by Anette Bening’s Dr Euphronius, while Christian Bale plays the monster and the Bride’s betrothed. Moving Mary Shelley’s Gothic novel into the roaring (19)20s, it looks like a sumptuous and beautifully-designed tragic romance. Project Hail Mary – 20th March Based on the novel by Andy Weir, Project Hail Mary sees Ryan Gosling’s unassuming science teacher blasted into space in a last-ditch effort to save humanity. The trailer gave away a bit more of the book’s events than we were expecting, so maybe avoid that if you want to go into the cinema completely cold. The adaptation’s by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, so expect plenty of humour and heart as well as Weir’s plausibly detailed science fiction. In a case of unfortunate cosmic timing, Project Hail Mary places it rather near another major sci-fi film from a director whose last big hit was also a Weir adaptation… The Dog Stars – 27th March There aren’t any images for The Dog Stars kicking around yet, so please accept this still from 1980s children’s TV show, Children Of The Dog Star. We used to quite like it. Some of Ridley Scott’s most beloved and influential movies are in the sci-fi genre – Alien, Blade Runner and The Martian (the Weir adaptation we were on about above) are all markedly different in tone, but all classics in their own way. We’re excited to see what Scott’s done with The Dog Stars, then: adapted from Peter Heller’s novel, it’s set in a future world ravaged by a pandemic. Holed up in an aircraft hangar, the two protagonists – Jacog Elordi’s pilot, Hig and Josh Brolin’s sniper, Bangley – are coaxed back into the open world by a mysterious signal. Margaret Qualley, Guy Pearce and Benedict Wong also star. Given Scott’s visual flair – even his uneven Alien prequels were often lovely to look at – this is arguably one of our most anticipated genre films of the year. The Mandalorian And Grogu – 22nd May Lucasfilm’s first Star Wars movie in seven years, The Mandalorian And Grogu takes the hit Disney+ series out for a big screen spin-off – making it the Holiday On The Buses of space fantasies. We don’t know much about the plot, and frankly, we don’t need to know: as long as director Jon Favreau delivers on the pace and spectacle, we should be in for a pulpy, entertaining evening at the pictures. Pedro Pascal, Grogu, Sigourney Weaver and Jeremy Allan White all star – the latter as the alarmingly buff son of the late Jabba. Disclosure Day – 12th June It’s an absurdly stuffed year for respected directors making genre films. And Disclosure Day could be the biggest of the lot: it’s the latest from Steven Spielberg, and a return to the UFO-based subject matter of Close Encounters Of The Third Kind. It’s written by David Koepp (see Cold Storage earlier), who previously worked with Spielberg on the adapted screenplay for Jurassic Park, and following the autobiographical drama of The Fabelmans , it’s a return to the summer blockbuster experience the filmmaker essentially invented. Emily Blunt, Josh O’Connor and Wyatt Russell star; it’s about an attempt to reveal the truth about alien intelligence to the world, and a shadowy attempt to stop it. We think. The trailer’s big on intrigue and low on plot specifics. It compels us, though. Flowervale Street – 10th August A generic picture of a dinosaur, courtesy of Public Domain Pictures. It Follows was one of the great horror movies of the 2010s, and here comes its director, David Robert Mitchell, with some sort of time-travelling IMAX thriller involving dinosaurs. Ewen McGregor and Anne Hathaway are the starriest names among the warm-blooded cast. At present, we don’t know a whole lot more about this one, either, but Mitchell is a hugely talented director of both comedy and suspense. His previous film, Under Silver Lake , was an unfairly overlooked commercial disappointment, but we thought it was an absolute keeper. As such, we’ve high hopes for Flowervale Street . Bring on the dinosaurs. The Hunger Games: Sunrise On The Reaping – 20th November Quentin Tarantino’s favourite killer contest franchise is back with another prequel, this one joining things up to the 2011 film that started it all. Hence why Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson are making a return as Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark. Expect more oppression, death and romance; Francis Lawrence has become a dab hand at making these. And as The Long Walk proved, he’s quite an underrated director, both technically and in the performances he gets from his actors. Dune: Part Three – 18th December An epic moment of epicness in Dune: Part Two. Credit: Warner Bros. The year ends with a pinch of spice courtesy of director Denis Villeneuve. Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya and the rest of the Dune crew are back for a third visit to Arrakis, and given that this chapter will sail beyond the confines of Frank Herbert’s original novel, which formed the basis for the first two movies, it’ll be fascinating to see where the Canadian filmmaker takes the saga next. Herbert’s own follow-up, Dune Messiah, had some truly wild ideas that might not translate too well onto a cinema screen, but Villeneuve’s previous adaptations were spectacularly done. Also coming up, with no release date attached: Ray Gunn, the animated sci-fi noir passion project from Brad Bird; Godzilla Minus Zero, the follow-up to instant kaiju klassic, Godzilla Minus One . You lucky, lucky people. /**/ Share this Article: ← Previous Podcast | Rocky IV (1985) and Rocky IV: Rocky Vs Drago – The Ultimate Director’s Cut (2021) Next → Rob Reiner | Filmmaker has died, at the age of 78 LATEST ISSUES Film Stories Issue 58!

Sign in to your CBR account Summary Generate a summary of this story follow Follow followed Followed Like Like Thread 2 Log in Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents: Try something different: Show me the facts Explain it like I’m 5 Give me a lighthearted recap 2025 has already seen some amazing movie releases, with Sinners dominating at the box office, ranking at number 11 on the list of the highest-grossing films of the year, according to Box Office Mojo . Superman and the live-action Lilo & Stitch remake have also done exceptionally well, bringing beloved characters back to the big screen. The end of the year is set to finish strong with Wicked: For Good , Avatar: Fire and Ash , and Five Nights at Freddy 's 2 set to release in November and December. Many animated films have fallen short, but the Chinese fantasy film N e Zha II is the highest-grossing film of 2025 thus far, and Disney is set to release the anticipated Zootopia 2 around Thanksgiving. 2026 is seeing the release of a variety of exciting animated films , including many sequels that are already inspiring hype in audiences who can't wait to see their favorite characters and new stories come to theaters. 10 Minions 3 Is Bound to Be Another Wacky Adventure Releasing July 1, 2026 Child Gru is intimidating one of the Minions in Minions: The Rise of Gru. Image via Illumination Minions: The Rise of Gru in 2022 made headlines not necessarily for critical reasons, but for its box office performance and an odd trend that may have been linked to its financial success. The \"gentleminions\" trend on TikTok saw several large groups of young men attending the film in suits, which seemed like a fun stunt until there were complaints about these viewers being particularly disruptive during screenings. Parents complained about not being able to enjoy the film with their kids because of littering, talking and other disturbances, which would appear again this year during A Minecraft Movie during the infamous \"chicken jockey\" scene . Minions 3 is likely not going to garner the same attention in meme culture as the trend died down once some theaters resorted to banning viewers in formal attire, but that won't stop families from attending to see the rambunctious yellow creatures get up to more mischief. Not many plot details about the film have been revealed, but Steve Carell is returning to voice Gru , and there are rumors that Alan Arkin will return as Wild Knuckles, who was prominently featured in the last film. 9 Ice Age 6 Will Hopefully Reinvigorate the Franchise Releasing December 18, 2026 Image Via 20th Century Animation With the critical bomb that was The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild , the last Ice Age film , things aren't looking so good for the franchise. With the first film being over two decades old, it may seem like audiences are tired of this franchise. However, the films have an exceptional voice cast with Ray Romano as Manny, Queen Latifah as Ellie, John Leguizamo as Sid and Simon Pegg as Buck. These are characters that audiences have grown up with and seen through catastrophic adventures. A story for the film hasn't been revealed yet , but an official poster for the film features familiar characters, including Brooke, voiced by Jessie J, and Shira, voiced by Jennifer Lopez, who are Sid and Diego's respective love interests. The poster sees Manny with his signature bulging eyes and worried expression while holding a spear, which could indicate another dangerous conflict for the found family of animals. 8 Goat is a Clever Play on Words For an Upcoming Sports Film Releasing February 13, 2026 Image Via Sony Pictures Animation Aside from a fun title and its appeal to basketball fans, Goat has an excellent creative team behind it. The film is directed by Tyree Dillihay, who is a director for the hit animated series Bob's Burgers , and Adam Rosette, who is a co-director at Sony Pictures Animation, known for his work on Orion and the Dark and The Wild Robot . Goat takes place in a world of anthropomorphic animals where a young goat named Will Harris dreams of becoming a professional basketball player despite his smaller stature. In addition to a great behind-the-scenes team, the cast is stacked with Stranger Things 's Caleb McLaughlin playing Will. His co-star, David Harbour, is also in the cast along with Nicola Coughlan, Nick Kroll, Gabrielle Union, Jenifer Lewis, Patton Oswalt and renowned basketball player Stephen Curry, who is also a producer for the film. The animation and designs for the animals are stunning, but it's to be expected from Sony Pictures Animation , whose inventive style has been impressing audiences since 2018 with Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse . 7 The Cat in the Hat Looks Like Another Inventive Dr. Seuss Story Brought to Life Releasing February 27, 2026 The Cat in the Hat poses in a car in the new movie. Image via Warner Bros. Many Dr. Seuss stories have made their way to the modern big screen in animated form, starting with Horton Hears a Who! in 2008 . Since then, Illumination has taken on the mantle, releasing The Lorax in 2012 and The Grinch in 2018. The Cat and the Hat is produced by Warner Bros. in the creative and popular 2.5D animation style, which melds hand-drawn animation with computer-generated animation. Comedian Bill Hader plays the chaotic Cat with Xochitl Gomez, Quinta Brunson, Matt Berry and Giancarlo Esposito also appearing in the cast. The film sees the Cat in the Hat , who has gained a reputation from the I.I.I.I. (Institute for the Institution of Imagination and Inspiration, LLC) for being irresponsible on his missions, facing his toughest task yet. He's tasked with cheering up two siblings who are struggling with their move to a new town. The film will bring some much-needed joy and laughter to audiences in addition to introducing Dr. Seuss's magical stories to new generations. 6 Shrek 5 Sees a New Chapter For the Ogre Family Releasing December 23, 2026 Shrek and Donkey scream in terror in Shrek 5 teaser Image via DreamWorks Animation Shrek 5 gained a massive amount of attention upon the release of its teaser earlier this year, with some Shrek fans complaining about the updated look of the characters and the changes that have been made to their design. Other fans expressed excitement over the original cast returning as well as the inclusion of Zendaya as Felicia, Shrek and Fiona's teenage daughter. The teaser is short, but it contains the same zippy and somewhat raunchy humor the series is known for , which is enough to have fans ready to be seated in theaters. As mentioned, Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz are returning as Shrek, Donkey and Fiona. Other characters like Pinocchio and the Magic Mirror make an appearance, with the Magic Mirror acting almost like a phone screen showing different edits and memes of Shrek to the horror, surprise, and excitement of the family. Major story details aren't out in the open yet, but many are theorizing that it will center around the relationship between Shrek and Felicia and her potential rebellious streak. 5 Toy Story 5 Brings the Toys Back Once Again Releasing June 19, 2026 Woody looks at Bo in Toy Story 4 Image via Pixar Since Toy Story was released in 1995, Woody, Buzz, Mr. Potato Head, Rex and the whole gang have been warming the hearts of families. Though Pixar's eclectic catalog is full of classics, there aren't any films quite like the Toy Story franchise . Woody separating from the rest of his family to be a lost toy with Bo Peep didn't sit well with all audiences at the divisive ending of Toy Story 4 , and many are wondering what the fifth film will entail. The plot will revolve around a very pertinent premise, with the toys having to compete with electronics, which have captured the attention of kids. Woody is featured in the concept art on the official Pixar website, and Tom Hanks is listed in the cast, so Woody is bound to make an appearance. Jessie, Bullseye, Hamm, Slinky and Forky, who was introduced in the last film, are also in the released pictures, so it seems like everyone's favorite characters are returning for the next installment . 4 The Legendaries Looks Like an Epic Fantasy Film Releasing January 28, 2026 Image via Pan Cinema Based on the comic book series of the same name by Patrick Sobral, The Legendaries follows a group of heroes who protect the fantastical world of Alysia. While fighting a formidable sorcerer named Darkhell, they end up breaking a magical stone that turns the powerful warriors into young children. All of humanity is cursed, and the once-revered heroes are forced into hiding as they're blamed for the unfortunate circumstances. The film sees the young heroes reunite and restore their friendship, on a quest to become the warriors they once were. The film is being directed by Guillaume Ivernel, who is known for Dragon Hunters , Spycies , and Leap! . Though The Legendaries is being produced in and being released first in France, fantasy fans worldwide can look forward to this film, as well as fans of the original series . 3 The Super Mario Bros. Movie Sequel Is Expected to Be an Amazing Follow-Up Releasing May 14, 2026 Mario and Luigi celebrating a job well done in The Super Mario Bros. Movie Image via Universal Pictures The Super Mario Bros. Movie was a colossal success in 2023, grossing $1.36 billion worldwide. Fans were ecstatic to see some of the most iconic video game characters of all time in a major motion picture. Though the astonishingly influential Nintendo games had been adapted before, in 1993, with Super Mario Bros., the film was a severe failure and has only gotten worse with age . The animated version, however, proved that retro video game movies can be spectacular with a dedicated story and voice cast. The film saw Mario, played by Chris Pratt, and Luigi, played by Charlie Day, enter the world of the Mushroom Kingdom ruled by the beautiful and fearless Princess Peach, played by Anya Taylor-Joy. The film featured tons of Easter eggs and references, and a humorous, engaging story that aligned perfectly with the games. Not much has been revealed about the sequel, but it's likely to introduce even more classic Mario characters and more threats for the brothers to face . 2 Hoppers Has a Creative Premise That May Inspire Deep Conversation Releasing March 6, 2026 Image via Pixar The teaser for Pixar's next feature, Hoppers, was released on July 16, 2025, and it's already garnered attention for its introspective look into nature. The film sees protagonist Mabel, as her brain is placed into the body of a beaver , so she can infiltrate a forest ecosystem and learn more about animals than humans thought possible . In doing so, she starts interfering with the natural order of things when she prevents a bear from eating a fellow beaver. The scientists who assisted in her transformation warn her about not disturbing nature, but Mabel seems committed to learning even more about her environment and protecting her animal friends. It seems that this film will include that signature emotional allure that many Pixar films contain . A balance of humor and heart is what the studio is known for, and Hoppers looks to invoke contemplative reactions from audiences that will leave the film making a lasting impression. 1 Wildwood Is Laika's First Film in Seven Years Releasing Sometime in 2026 Image via Laika Known for their stunning stop-motion films, including the whimsical and terrifying Coraline , Laika is finally set to deliver a new project that's sure to be nothing but spectacular. Wildwood , based on the novel by Colin Meloy , the lead singer and songwriter for the rock band The Decemberists, follows the hero protagonist Prue McKeel, whose younger brother is kidnapped and taken into the depths of a strange forest. The film is directed by Travis Knight, who directed another mystical Laika film, Kubo and the Two Strings . The screenplay is written by Chris Butler, who directed Laika's last film, Missing Link . The cast includes the voice talents of Jacob Tremblay, Carey Mulligan, Peyton Elizabeth Lee, Mahershala Ali, Maya Erskine and Charlie Day. With such a focus on winding woods, strange creatures and family bonds, Laika is the perfect studio to develop this story and is sure to entrance audiences with stellar stop-motion , immersing them in an expansive world that won't be easily forgotten.

Personally I can't get that excited to see another Ice Age movie or even the Minions. An interestingly, while a couple of these look really good, I can't help but notice there's not a single traditionally animated film on the list. We produce some really good stuff here in the US but man it troubles me that this country has all but abandoned traditional animation. CGI is great but it shouldn't be the only thing out there. The only thing on here is the number one choice by Laika Studios because even though they're also doing CGI, at least their stuff is always original. 2025-08-07 12:11:59 Upvote 1 Downvote Reply Copy Rob Rob Rob #HZ842145 Member since 2023-10-22 Following 0 Topics 0 Users Follow Followed 0  Followers View The Legendaries is the only one that really intrest me, but i will most likly gey draged to several others 2025-08-07 12:57:12 Upvote Downvote Reply Copy Terms Privacy Feedback Recommended After Rewatching Frozen, I Realized Everyone's Wrong About the $1.3 B Disney Movie's Most Important Song Fallout Season 2 Release Date & Time: When New Episodes Drop on Prime Video 1 of Deadliest Decepticons in Transformers History Returns With New Design Reveal Chainsaw Man Takes '1 Giant Leap' Into Power Creep Trending Now The Sci-Fi Classic Roger Ebert Called a 10/10 Masterpiece Gets High Praise From NASA Astronaut Crunchyroll Accidentally Reveals the Fate of Dragon Ball Daima's Future This Paul Dano Sleeper Set the Bar for Thrillers by Delivering the Darkest Ending of the 2010s Join Our Team Our Audience About Us Press & Events Media Coverage Contact Us Follow Us Advertising Careers Terms Privacy Policies CBR is part of the Valnet Publishing Group Copyright © 2025 Valnet Inc.",

Sign in to your CBR account Summary Generate a summary of this story follow Follow followed Followed Like Like Thread 2 Log in Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents: Try something different: Show me the facts Explain it like I’m 5 Give me a lighthearted recap 2025 has already seen some amazing movie releases, with Sinners dominating at the box office, ranking at number 11 on the list of the highest-grossing films of the year, according to Box Office Mojo . Superman and the live-action Lilo & Stitch remake have also done exceptionally well, bringing beloved characters back to the big screen. The end of the year is set to finish strong with Wicked: For Good , Avatar: Fire and Ash , and Five Nights at Freddy 's 2 set to release in November and December. Many animated films have fallen short, but the Chinese fantasy film N e Zha II is the highest-grossing film of 2025 thus far, and Disney is set to release the anticipated Zootopia 2 around Thanksgiving. 2026 is seeing the release of a variety of exciting animated films , including many sequels that are already inspiring hype in audiences who can't wait to see their favorite characters and new stories come to theaters. 10 Minions 3 Is Bound to Be Another Wacky Adventure Releasing July 1, 2026 Child Gru is intimidating one of the Minions in Minions: The Rise of Gru. Image via Illumination Minions: The Rise of Gru in 2022 made headlines not necessarily for critical reasons, but for its box office performance and an odd trend that may have been linked to its financial success. The \"gentleminions\" trend on TikTok saw several large groups of young men attending the film in suits, which seemed like a fun stunt until there were complaints about these viewers being particularly disruptive during screenings. Parents complained about not being able to enjoy the film with their kids because of littering, talking and other disturbances, which would appear again this year during A Minecraft Movie during the infamous \"chicken jockey\" scene . Minions 3 is likely not going to garner the same attention in meme culture as the trend died down once some theaters resorted to banning viewers in formal attire, but that won't stop families from attending to see the rambunctious yellow creatures get up to more mischief. Not many plot details about the film have been revealed, but Steve Carell is returning to voice Gru , and there are rumors that Alan Arkin will return as Wild Knuckles, who was prominently featured in the last film. 9 Ice Age 6 Will Hopefully Reinvigorate the Franchise Releasing December 18, 2026 Image Via 20th Century Animation With the critical bomb that was The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild , the last Ice Age film , things aren't looking so good for the franchise. With the first film being over two decades old, it may seem like audiences are tired of this franchise. However, the films have an exceptional voice cast with Ray Romano as Manny, Queen Latifah as Ellie, John Leguizamo as Sid and Simon Pegg as Buck. These are characters that audiences have grown up with and seen through catastrophic adventures. A story for the film hasn't been revealed yet , but an official poster for the film features familiar characters, including Brooke, voiced by Jessie J, and Shira, voiced by Jennifer Lopez, who are Sid and Diego's respective love interests. The poster sees Manny with his signature bulging eyes and worried expression while holding a spear, which could indicate another dangerous conflict for the found family of animals. 8 Goat is a Clever Play on Words For an Upcoming Sports Film Releasing February 13, 2026 Image Via Sony Pictures Animation Aside from a fun title and its appeal to basketball fans, Goat has an excellent creative team behind it. The film is directed by Tyree Dillihay, who is a director for the hit animated series Bob's Burgers , and Adam Rosette, who is a co-director at Sony Pictures Animation, known for his work on Orion and the Dark and The Wild Robot . Goat takes place in a world of anthropomorphic animals where a young goat named Will Harris dreams of becoming a professional basketball player despite his smaller stature. In addition to a great behind-the-scenes team, the cast is stacked with Stranger Things 's Caleb McLaughlin playing Will. His co-star, David Harbour, is also in the cast along with Nicola Coughlan, Nick Kroll, Gabrielle Union, Jenifer Lewis, Patton Oswalt and renowned basketball player Stephen Curry, who is also a producer for the film. The animation and designs for the animals are stunning, but it's to be expected from Sony Pictures Animation , whose inventive style has been impressing audiences since 2018 with Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse . 7 The Cat in the Hat Looks Like Another Inventive Dr. Seuss Story Brought to Life Releasing February 27, 2026 The Cat in the Hat poses in a car in the new movie. Image via Warner Bros. Many Dr. Seuss stories have made their way to the modern big screen in animated form, starting with Horton Hears a Who! in 2008 . Since then, Illumination has taken on the mantle, releasing The Lorax in 2012 and The Grinch in 2018. The Cat and the Hat is produced by Warner Bros. in the creative and popular 2.5D animation style, which melds hand-drawn animation with computer-generated animation. Comedian Bill Hader plays the chaotic Cat with Xochitl Gomez, Quinta Brunson, Matt Berry and Giancarlo Esposito also appearing in the cast. The film sees the Cat in the Hat , who has gained a reputation from the I.I.I.I. (Institute for the Institution of Imagination and Inspiration, LLC) for being irresponsible on his missions, facing his toughest task yet. He's tasked with cheering up two siblings who are struggling with their move to a new town. The film will bring some much-needed joy and laughter to audiences in addition to introducing Dr. Seuss's magical stories to new generations. 6 Shrek 5 Sees a New Chapter For the Ogre Family Releasing December 23, 2026 Shrek and Donkey scream in terror in Shrek 5 teaser Image via DreamWorks Animation Shrek 5 gained a massive amount of attention upon the release of its teaser earlier this year, with some Shrek fans complaining about the updated look of the characters and the changes that have been made to their design. Other fans expressed excitement over the original cast returning as well as the inclusion of Zendaya as Felicia, Shrek and Fiona's teenage daughter. The teaser is short, but it contains the same zippy and somewhat raunchy humor the series is known for , which is enough to have fans ready to be seated in theaters. As mentioned, Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz are returning as Shrek, Donkey and Fiona. Other characters like Pinocchio and the Magic Mirror make an appearance, with the Magic Mirror acting almost like a phone screen showing different edits and memes of Shrek to the horror, surprise, and excitement of the family. Major story details aren't out in the open yet, but many are theorizing that it will center around the relationship between Shrek and Felicia and her potential rebellious streak. 5 Toy Story 5 Brings the Toys Back Once Again Releasing June 19, 2026 Woody looks at Bo in Toy Story 4 Image via Pixar Since Toy Story was released in 1995, Woody, Buzz, Mr. Potato Head, Rex and the whole gang have been warming the hearts of families. Though Pixar's eclectic catalog is full of classics, there aren't any films quite like the Toy Story franchise . Woody separating from the rest of his family to be a lost toy with Bo Peep didn't sit well with all audiences at the divisive ending of Toy Story 4 , and many are wondering what the fifth film will entail. The plot will revolve around a very pertinent premise, with the toys having to compete with electronics, which have captured the attention of kids. Woody is featured in the concept art on the official Pixar website, and Tom Hanks is listed in the cast, so Woody is bound to make an appearance. Jessie, Bullseye, Hamm, Slinky and Forky, who was introduced in the last film, are also in the released pictures, so it seems like everyone's favorite characters are returning for the next installment . 4 The Legendaries Looks Like an Epic Fantasy Film Releasing January 28, 2026 Image via Pan Cinema Based on the comic book series of the same name by Patrick Sobral, The Legendaries follows a group of heroes who protect the fantastical world of Alysia. While fighting a formidable sorcerer named Darkhell, they end up breaking a magical stone that turns the powerful warriors into young children. All of humanity is cursed, and the once-revered heroes are forced into hiding as they're blamed for the unfortunate circumstances. The film sees the young heroes reunite and restore their friendship, on a quest to become the warriors they once were. The film is being directed by Guillaume Ivernel, who is known for Dragon Hunters , Spycies , and Leap! . Though The Legendaries is being produced in and being released first in France, fantasy fans worldwide can look forward to this film, as well as fans of the original series . 3 The Super Mario Bros. Movie Sequel Is Expected to Be an Amazing Follow-Up Releasing May 14, 2026 Mario and Luigi celebrating a job well done in The Super Mario Bros. Movie Image via Universal Pictures The Super Mario Bros. Movie was a colossal success in 2023, grossing $1.36 billion worldwide. Fans were ecstatic to see some of the most iconic video game characters of all time in a major motion picture. Though the astonishingly influential Nintendo games had been adapted before, in 1993, with Super Mario Bros., the film was a severe failure and has only gotten worse with age . The animated version, however, proved that retro video game movies can be spectacular with a dedicated story and voice cast. The film saw Mario, played by Chris Pratt, and Luigi, played by Charlie Day, enter the world of the Mushroom Kingdom ruled by the beautiful and fearless Princess Peach, played by Anya Taylor-Joy. The film featured tons of Easter eggs and references, and a humorous, engaging story that aligned perfectly with the games. Not much has been revealed about the sequel, but it's likely to introduce even more classic Mario characters and more threats for the brothers to face . 2 Hoppers Has a Creative Premise That May Inspire Deep Conversation Releasing March 6, 2026 Image via Pixar The teaser for Pixar's next feature, Hoppers, was released on July 16, 2025, and it's already garnered attention for its introspective look into nature. The film sees protagonist Mabel, as her brain is placed into the body of a beaver , so she can infiltrate a forest ecosystem and learn more about animals than humans thought possible . In doing so, she starts interfering with the natural order of things when she prevents a bear from eating a fellow beaver. The scientists who assisted in her transformation warn her about not disturbing nature, but Mabel seems committed to learning even more about her environment and protecting her animal friends. It seems that this film will include that signature emotional allure that many Pixar films contain . A balance of humor and heart is what the studio is known for, and Hoppers looks to invoke contemplative reactions from audiences that will leave the film making a lasting impression. 1 Wildwood Is Laika's First Film in Seven Years Releasing Sometime in 2026 Image via Laika Known for their stunning stop-motion films, including the whimsical and terrifying Coraline , Laika is finally set to deliver a new project that's sure to be nothing but spectacular. Wildwood , based on the novel by Colin Meloy , the lead singer and songwriter for the rock band The Decemberists, follows the hero protagonist Prue McKeel, whose younger brother is kidnapped and taken into the depths of a strange forest. The film is directed by Travis Knight, who directed another mystical Laika film, Kubo and the Two Strings . The screenplay is written by Chris Butler, who directed Laika's last film, Missing Link . The cast includes the voice talents of Jacob Tremblay, Carey Mulligan, Peyton Elizabeth Lee, Mahershala Ali, Maya Erskine and Charlie Day. With such a focus on winding woods, strange creatures and family bonds, Laika is the perfect studio to develop this story and is sure to entrance audiences with stellar stop-motion , immersing them in an expansive world that won't be easily forgotten.

Personally I can't get that excited to see another Ice Age movie or even the Minions. An interestingly, while a couple of these look really good, I can't help but notice there's not a single traditionally animated film on the list. We produce some really good stuff here in the US but man it troubles me that this country has all but abandoned traditional animation. CGI is great but it shouldn't be the only thing out there. The only thing on here is the number one choice by Laika Studios because even though they're also doing CGI, at least their stuff is always original. 2025-08-07 12:11:59 Upvote 1 Downvote Reply Copy Rob Rob Rob #HZ842145 Member since 2023-10-22 Following 0 Topics 0 Users Follow Followed 0  Followers View The Legendaries is the only one that really intrest me, but i will most likly gey draged to several others 2025-08-07 12:57:12 Upvote Downvote Reply Copy Terms Privacy Feedback Recommended After Rewatching Frozen, I Realized Everyone's Wrong About the $1.3 B Disney Movie's Most Important Song Crunchyroll Accidentally Reveals the Fate of Dragon Ball Daima's Future Christian Bale’s ‘Impeccably Made’ Drama Like ‘Pure Unfiltered Adrenaline’ Coming to Netflix Fallout Fans Get a Surprise Prime Video Update Hours Before Season 2 Drops Trending Now The Next Three Avengers: Doomsday Trailers Allegedly Will Focus On These MCU Characters Fallout Season 2 Release Date & Time: When New Episodes Drop on Prime Video Rob Reiner’s Son Officially Charged With First Degree Murder Join Our Team Our Audience About Us Press & Events Media Coverage Contact Us Follow Us Advertising Careers Terms Privacy Policies CBR is part of the Valnet Publishing Group Copyright © 2025 Valnet Inc.",

Although major new IPs from giants like Disney and Pixar did badly at the box office, surprise hits – like KPop Demon Hunters becoming Netflix's most-streamed show ever – demonstrate a strong appetite for animation, including among adult audiences. The good news is that animation in 2026 is looking fantastic, with a strong bill of movies and series lined up. And while some of the biggest releases are sequels, there are also some original stories coming, including from giants like Pixar, Disney and DreamWorks.

The critical 3D art trends that will impact 2026 9 animated movies and series to look out for in 2026 The Darwin Incident TVアニメ『ダーウィン事変』　第1弾PV／2026.01 OA AIR - YouTube Watch On Production company : Bellnox Films Release date : January 2026 Kicking of the best animation of 2026 in January, The Darwin Incident is a hotly anticipated series based on Shun Umezawa's award-winning manga. It follows the story of a 15-year-old \"humanzee\" hybrid called Charlie as he battles through the tribulations of US high school life and gets mixed up with an extremist eco-terrorist group that wants to take advantage of him. The series should be one of the most intellectual animations in 2026, exploring themes like identity, discrimination and moral limits as well as biotechnology. If Bellnox manages a faithful adaptation of the manga, it should be a gripping but thought-provoking animated thriller, and a great start for animated series in 2026. GOAT GOAT - Official Teaser Trailer (HD) - YouTube Watch On Production company : Columbia Pictures, Sony Pictures Animation, Unanimous Media, Modern Magic Release date : 13 February, 2026 ZooTopia 2 hits the big screen this month, but Sony Animations is hoping it can steal Disney's glory and become the GOAT of new animated movies with anthropomorphic animals. This sports comedy directed by Tyree Dillihay applies a Spider Verse-like animation style to basketball action in the tale of a goat called Will Harris who gets a shot at the big time in 'roarball', a high-intensity contact sport where only the fastest and fiercest animals can shine. With KPop Demon Hunters, Sony has boosted its reputation for animation. GOAT will show whether it can now deliver at the box office outside of the Spider-Verse.

Hoppers Hoppers | Teaser Trailer | In theaters March 6 - YouTube Watch On Production company: Pixar Animation Studios Release date: 6 March, 2026 Pixar's Elio failed to set box offices on fire in 2025. Can Hoppers make up for that and bring back Pixar's former glory for quirky original animations? Directed by Daniel Chong (We Bare Bears) from a screenplay by Jesse Andrews, the science-fiction comedy looks quite different from other Pixar movies. It could be helped by the featuring an older protagonist: 19-year-old animal lover Mabel Tanaka, whose uses technology to transfer her mind into a robotic beaver to join the animal world. Piper Curda, Bobby Moynihan and Jon Hamm are some of the voices. The Super Mario Galaxy Movie The Super Mario Galaxy Movie – Official Trailer - YouTube Watch On Production company: Illumination, Nintendo Release date: 3 April, 2026 The Super Mario Galaxy Movie reunites the cast from the 2023 film, with Chris Pratt as Mario alongside Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Day and Keegan-Michael Key. Some fans are concerned about the leap from Super Mario Bros to Super Mario Galaxy, which means skipping a bunch of Mario lore in Super Mario World, but we're looking forward to seeing what's in store for Bowser, whose personality is being explored more than in the games. You may like Could Stranger Things Tales from '85 be the ultimate retro cartoon? The critical 3D art trends that will impact 2026 Zootopia 2 could become Disney's biggest movie ever – here's how it was made In The Super Mario Bros. Movie, we saw King Koopa shrunken by a Mini Mushroom and imprisoned in a cage. It seems he's now been transferred into a magnificent castle where he's been 'working through his demons' and using art as a creative outlet. Daemons of the Shadow Realm Daemons of the Shadow Realm | Official Trailer 3 | Crunchyroll - YouTube Watch On Production company: Bones Film Release date: April 2026 After Fullmetal Alchemist and Silver Spoon, Hiromu Arakawa's Daemons of the Shadow Realm is hugely anticipated in the world of manga anime. The series looks set to deliver a return to high-concept fantasy storytelling. The story will explore the strength of sibling bonds, following two twins, Yuru and Asa, who were separated and tied to daemons. Arakawa has a reputation for developing complex moral themes in convincing worlds, and the upcoming animated series' looks like another perfect example. The rural world looks intriguing and mysterious, promising the perfect backdrop for a clash between ordinary lives with powerful supernatural forces. I'm hoping that Daemons of the Shadow Realm will be a modern fantasy classic. Toy Story 5 Toy Story 5 | Teaser Trailer | In Theaters June 19 - YouTube Watch On Production company: Pixar Animation Studios Release date: 19 June, 2026 Our team has been a bit torn over Toy Story 5. For many of us, the franchise feels like it's been part of our lives forever, so we have to include it in our list of animated movies to watch in 2026. Some fans have questioned the consistency of the timeline. Some also fear that the fifth installation sounds very similar to the first, but the premise of toys worried about being replaced feel more relevant than ever in this AI era. What we can agree on is that the animation in the trailer looks wonderfully polished (see the news on the release of RenderMan 27 if you want to try Pixar's rendering advances for yourself). Forgotten Island Production company: DreamWorks Release date: September 25, 2026 While Pixar has Hoppers and Disney has Hexed, Forgotten Island is DreamWorks' contender as a major studio original animated movie for 2026. We've not seen anything of this movie yet, but the concept sounds enticing, and curiously dark for a DreamWorks movie Forgotten Island will tell the story of two best friends trapped in a magical world with the only way home requiring them to forget each other forever. There's a star-studded voice cast lined up, with Lea Salonga, Dave Franco, Jenny Slate, Manny Jacinto, H.E.R. and Liza Soberano, and the movie will be directed by Joel Crawford, who did Puss in Boots. The Cat in the Hat The Cat in the Hat | Official Trailer - YouTube Watch On Production company: Warner Bros. Pictures Animation Release date: 6 November, 2026 The Cat and the Hat looks like it could be the closest Warner Bros has got yet to a Pixar-level animated movie. The Dr Seuss story will return to the big screen with a combination of stylised 2D animation and CG animation that should please fans who grew up with the book much more than that 2003 live-action movie with Mike Myers. The movie's being directed by Alessandro Carloni and Erica Rivinoja, with Bill Hader leading the voice cast and DNEG providing the animation. Some parts of the trailer remind me of the animation style of Nimona and also Max's Gremlins TV series. It looks like the style will change in the different worlds, veering towards CG realism in the real world while using cel shading in The Institute of Imagination. Hexed [Hexed] 2026년 가을 대개봉 - YouTube Watch On Production company: Walt Disney Animation Studios Release date: 25 November, 2026 We don't yet know much about Disney's Hexed, so perhaps it's a bit too early to say that it's one of the animated movies to watch in 2026, but we any new, original Disney movie is worth keeping an eye out for. All the studio has said is that Hexed will follow an awkward teenage boy and his 'Type A mom' as they discover that the lad might have magical powers. It sounds like the action will take place in the real world as well as a “secret world of magic”, both of which are turned upside down by the realisation. Disney's take on Harry Potter? We'll see, but it's notable that like Pixar's Hoppers this will see an teenage protagonist rather than a child, which could help the movie's fortunes. We're looking forward to the trailers to see what the animation style looks like. Fans of 2D animation are hoping that the movie will look like the beautifully stylised Hexed concept art that Disney released back in September, but will Disney really take a break from 3D? Upcoming animations further ahead in 2027 Further ahead, we have more exciting animation projects to look forward to in 2027. Big mainstream sequels will include Shrek 5 and Ice Age 6. Kojima Production's will bring its Death Stranding anime series to Disney+ (yes, really), and we'll also have the film that could take Indian animation global: Baahubali: The Eternal War Part 1 looks stunning with its Arcane-like art style mixing 2D and 3D animation. Want to work in animation yourself? Make sure you're familiar with the Disney principles of animation.

Sign in to your CBR account Summary Generate a summary of this story follow Follow followed Followed Like Like Thread 2 Log in Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents: Try something different: Show me the facts Explain it like I’m 5 Give me a lighthearted recap 2025 has already seen some amazing movie releases, with Sinners dominating at the box office, ranking at number 11 on the list of the highest-grossing films of the year, according to Box Office Mojo . Superman and the live-action Lilo & Stitch remake have also done exceptionally well, bringing beloved characters back to the big screen. The end of the year is set to finish strong with Wicked: For Good , Avatar: Fire and Ash , and Five Nights at Freddy 's 2 set to release in November and December. Many animated films have fallen short, but the Chinese fantasy film N e Zha II is the highest-grossing film of 2025 thus far, and Disney is set to release the anticipated Zootopia 2 around Thanksgiving. 2026 is seeing the release of a variety of exciting animated films , including many sequels that are already inspiring hype in audiences who can't wait to see their favorite characters and new stories come to theaters. 10 Minions 3 Is Bound to Be Another Wacky Adventure Releasing July 1, 2026 Child Gru is intimidating one of the Minions in Minions: The Rise of Gru. Image via Illumination Minions: The Rise of Gru in 2022 made headlines not necessarily for critical reasons, but for its box office performance and an odd trend that may have been linked to its financial success. The \"gentleminions\" trend on TikTok saw several large groups of young men attending the film in suits, which seemed like a fun stunt until there were complaints about these viewers being particularly disruptive during screenings. Parents complained about not being able to enjoy the film with their kids because of littering, talking and other disturbances, which would appear again this year during A Minecraft Movie during the infamous \"chicken jockey\" scene . Minions 3 is likely not going to garner the same attention in meme culture as the trend died down once some theaters resorted to banning viewers in formal attire, but that won't stop families from attending to see the rambunctious yellow creatures get up to more mischief. Not many plot details about the film have been revealed, but Steve Carell is returning to voice Gru , and there are rumors that Alan Arkin will return as Wild Knuckles, who was prominently featured in the last film. 9 Ice Age 6 Will Hopefully Reinvigorate the Franchise Releasing December 18, 2026 Image Via 20th Century Animation With the critical bomb that was The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild , the last Ice Age film , things aren't looking so good for the franchise. With the first film being over two decades old, it may seem like audiences are tired of this franchise. However, the films have an exceptional voice cast with Ray Romano as Manny, Queen Latifah as Ellie, John Leguizamo as Sid and Simon Pegg as Buck. These are characters that audiences have grown up with and seen through catastrophic adventures. A story for the film hasn't been revealed yet , but an official poster for the film features familiar characters, including Brooke, voiced by Jessie J, and Shira, voiced by Jennifer Lopez, who are Sid and Diego's respective love interests. The poster sees Manny with his signature bulging eyes and worried expression while holding a spear, which could indicate another dangerous conflict for the found family of animals. 8 Goat is a Clever Play on Words For an Upcoming Sports Film Releasing February 13, 2026 Image Via Sony Pictures Animation Aside from a fun title and its appeal to basketball fans, Goat has an excellent creative team behind it. The film is directed by Tyree Dillihay, who is a director for the hit animated series Bob's Burgers , and Adam Rosette, who is a co-director at Sony Pictures Animation, known for his work on Orion and the Dark and The Wild Robot . Goat takes place in a world of anthropomorphic animals where a young goat named Will Harris dreams of becoming a professional basketball player despite his smaller stature. In addition to a great behind-the-scenes team, the cast is stacked with Stranger Things 's Caleb McLaughlin playing Will. His co-star, David Harbour, is also in the cast along with Nicola Coughlan, Nick Kroll, Gabrielle Union, Jenifer Lewis, Patton Oswalt and renowned basketball player Stephen Curry, who is also a producer for the film. The animation and designs for the animals are stunning, but it's to be expected from Sony Pictures Animation , whose inventive style has been impressing audiences since 2018 with Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse . 7 The Cat in the Hat Looks Like Another Inventive Dr. Seuss Story Brought to Life Releasing February 27, 2026 The Cat in the Hat poses in a car in the new movie. Image via Warner Bros. Many Dr. Seuss stories have made their way to the modern big screen in animated form, starting with Horton Hears a Who! in 2008 . Since then, Illumination has taken on the mantle, releasing The Lorax in 2012 and The Grinch in 2018. The Cat and the Hat is produced by Warner Bros. in the creative and popular 2.5D animation style, which melds hand-drawn animation with computer-generated animation. Comedian Bill Hader plays the chaotic Cat with Xochitl Gomez, Quinta Brunson, Matt Berry and Giancarlo Esposito also appearing in the cast. The film sees the Cat in the Hat , who has gained a reputation from the I.I.I.I. (Institute for the Institution of Imagination and Inspiration, LLC) for being irresponsible on his missions, facing his toughest task yet. He's tasked with cheering up two siblings who are struggling with their move to a new town. The film will bring some much-needed joy and laughter to audiences in addition to introducing Dr. Seuss's magical stories to new generations. 6 Shrek 5 Sees a New Chapter For the Ogre Family Releasing December 23, 2026 Shrek and Donkey scream in terror in Shrek 5 teaser Image via DreamWorks Animation Shrek 5 gained a massive amount of attention upon the release of its teaser earlier this year, with some Shrek fans complaining about the updated look of the characters and the changes that have been made to their design. Other fans expressed excitement over the original cast returning as well as the inclusion of Zendaya as Felicia, Shrek and Fiona's teenage daughter. The teaser is short, but it contains the same zippy and somewhat raunchy humor the series is known for , which is enough to have fans ready to be seated in theaters. As mentioned, Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz are returning as Shrek, Donkey and Fiona. Other characters like Pinocchio and the Magic Mirror make an appearance, with the Magic Mirror acting almost like a phone screen showing different edits and memes of Shrek to the horror, surprise, and excitement of the family. Major story details aren't out in the open yet, but many are theorizing that it will center around the relationship between Shrek and Felicia and her potential rebellious streak. 5 Toy Story 5 Brings the Toys Back Once Again Releasing June 19, 2026 Woody looks at Bo in Toy Story 4 Image via Pixar Since Toy Story was released in 1995, Woody, Buzz, Mr. Potato Head, Rex and the whole gang have been warming the hearts of families. Though Pixar's eclectic catalog is full of classics, there aren't any films quite like the Toy Story franchise . Woody separating from the rest of his family to be a lost toy with Bo Peep didn't sit well with all audiences at the divisive ending of Toy Story 4 , and many are wondering what the fifth film will entail. The plot will revolve around a very pertinent premise, with the toys having to compete with electronics, which have captured the attention of kids. Woody is featured in the concept art on the official Pixar website, and Tom Hanks is listed in the cast, so Woody is bound to make an appearance. Jessie, Bullseye, Hamm, Slinky and Forky, who was introduced in the last film, are also in the released pictures, so it seems like everyone's favorite characters are returning for the next installment . 4 The Legendaries Looks Like an Epic Fantasy Film Releasing January 28, 2026 Image via Pan Cinema Based on the comic book series of the same name by Patrick Sobral, The Legendaries follows a group of heroes who protect the fantastical world of Alysia. While fighting a formidable sorcerer named Darkhell, they end up breaking a magical stone that turns the powerful warriors into young children. All of humanity is cursed, and the once-revered heroes are forced into hiding as they're blamed for the unfortunate circumstances. The film sees the young heroes reunite and restore their friendship, on a quest to become the warriors they once were. The film is being directed by Guillaume Ivernel, who is known for Dragon Hunters , Spycies , and Leap! . Though The Legendaries is being produced in and being released first in France, fantasy fans worldwide can look forward to this film, as well as fans of the original series . 3 The Super Mario Bros. Movie Sequel Is Expected to Be an Amazing Follow-Up Releasing May 14, 2026 Mario and Luigi celebrating a job well done in The Super Mario Bros. Movie Image via Universal Pictures The Super Mario Bros. Movie was a colossal success in 2023, grossing $1.36 billion worldwide. Fans were ecstatic to see some of the most iconic video game characters of all time in a major motion picture. Though the astonishingly influential Nintendo games had been adapted before, in 1993, with Super Mario Bros., the film was a severe failure and has only gotten worse with age . The animated version, however, proved that retro video game movies can be spectacular with a dedicated story and voice cast. The film saw Mario, played by Chris Pratt, and Luigi, played by Charlie Day, enter the world of the Mushroom Kingdom ruled by the beautiful and fearless Princess Peach, played by Anya Taylor-Joy. The film featured tons of Easter eggs and references, and a humorous, engaging story that aligned perfectly with the games. Not much has been revealed about the sequel, but it's likely to introduce even more classic Mario characters and more threats for the brothers to face . 2 Hoppers Has a Creative Premise That May Inspire Deep Conversation Releasing March 6, 2026 Image via Pixar The teaser for Pixar's next feature, Hoppers, was released on July 16, 2025, and it's already garnered attention for its introspective look into nature. The film sees protagonist Mabel, as her brain is placed into the body of a beaver , so she can infiltrate a forest ecosystem and learn more about animals than humans thought possible . In doing so, she starts interfering with the natural order of things when she prevents a bear from eating a fellow beaver. The scientists who assisted in her transformation warn her about not disturbing nature, but Mabel seems committed to learning even more about her environment and protecting her animal friends. It seems that this film will include that signature emotional allure that many Pixar films contain . A balance of humor and heart is what the studio is known for, and Hoppers looks to invoke contemplative reactions from audiences that will leave the film making a lasting impression. 1 Wildwood Is Laika's First Film in Seven Years Releasing Sometime in 2026 Image via Laika Known for their stunning stop-motion films, including the whimsical and terrifying Coraline , Laika is finally set to deliver a new project that's sure to be nothing but spectacular. Wildwood , based on the novel by Colin Meloy , the lead singer and songwriter for the rock band The Decemberists, follows the hero protagonist Prue McKeel, whose younger brother is kidnapped and taken into the depths of a strange forest. The film is directed by Travis Knight, who directed another mystical Laika film, Kubo and the Two Strings . The screenplay is written by Chris Butler, who directed Laika's last film, Missing Link . The cast includes the voice talents of Jacob Tremblay, Carey Mulligan, Peyton Elizabeth Lee, Mahershala Ali, Maya Erskine and Charlie Day. With such a focus on winding woods, strange creatures and family bonds, Laika is the perfect studio to develop this story and is sure to entrance audiences with stellar stop-motion , immersing them in an expansive world that won't be easily forgotten.

Personally I can't get that excited to see another Ice Age movie or even the Minions. An interestingly, while a couple of these look really good, I can't help but notice there's not a single traditionally animated film on the list. We produce some really good stuff here in the US but man it troubles me that this country has all but abandoned traditional animation. CGI is great but it shouldn't be the only thing out there. The only thing on here is the number one choice by Laika Studios because even though they're also doing CGI, at least their stuff is always original. 2025-08-07 12:11:59 Upvote 1 Downvote Reply Copy Rob Rob Rob #HZ842145 Member since 2023-10-22 Following 0 Topics 0 Users Follow Followed 0  Followers View The Legendaries is the only one that really intrest me, but i will most likly gey draged to several others 2025-08-07 12:57:12 Upvote Downvote Reply Copy Terms Privacy Feedback Recommended After Rewatching Frozen, I Realized Everyone's Wrong About the $1.3 B Disney Movie's Most Important Song March 2026 Will Be a Great Month for Solo Leveling Fans Christopher Nolan’s The Odyssey New Look Reveals Batman Actor in Major Role The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Struggle With Their New Familiar Foe in an Advance Preview Trending Now Marvel Studios Set a Dismal Box Office Record This Year (And One Stat Will Blow Your Mind) 17 Years Later, The Greatest Sci-Fi RPG of All Time Is 100% Untouchable Baldur's Gate 3 Devs Using AI for Next Game (& Gamers Are Salty) Join Our Team Our Audience About Us Press & Events Media Coverage Contact Us Follow Us Advertising Careers Terms Privacy Policies CBR is part of the Valnet Publishing Group Copyright © 2025 Valnet Inc.",

Although major new IPs from giants like Disney and Pixar did badly at the box office, surprise hits – like KPop Demon Hunters becoming Netflix's most-streamed show ever – demonstrate a strong appetite for animation, including among adult audiences. The good news is that animation in 2026 is looking fantastic, with a strong bill of movies and series lined up. And while some of the biggest releases are sequels, there are also some original stories coming, including from giants like Pixar, Disney and DreamWorks.

The critical 3D art trends that will impact 2026 9 animated movies and series to look out for in 2026 The Darwin Incident TVアニメ『ダーウィン事変』　第1弾PV／2026.01 OA AIR - YouTube Watch On Production company : Bellnox Films Release date : January 2026 Kicking of the best animation of 2026 in January, The Darwin Incident is a hotly anticipated series based on Shun Umezawa's award-winning manga. It follows the story of a 15-year-old \"humanzee\" hybrid called Charlie as he battles through the tribulations of US high school life and gets mixed up with an extremist eco-terrorist group that wants to take advantage of him. The series should be one of the most intellectual animations in 2026, exploring themes like identity, discrimination and moral limits as well as biotechnology. If Bellnox manages a faithful adaptation of the manga, it should be a gripping but thought-provoking animated thriller, and a great start for animated series in 2026. GOAT GOAT - Official Teaser Trailer (HD) - YouTube Watch On Production company : Columbia Pictures, Sony Pictures Animation, Unanimous Media, Modern Magic Release date : 13 February, 2026 ZooTopia 2 hits the big screen this month, but Sony Animations is hoping it can steal Disney's glory and become the GOAT of new animated movies with anthropomorphic animals. This sports comedy directed by Tyree Dillihay applies a Spider Verse-like animation style to basketball action in the tale of a goat called Will Harris who gets a shot at the big time in 'roarball', a high-intensity contact sport where only the fastest and fiercest animals can shine. With KPop Demon Hunters, Sony has boosted its reputation for animation. GOAT will show whether it can now deliver at the box office outside of the Spider-Verse.

Hoppers Hoppers | Teaser Trailer | In theaters March 6 - YouTube Watch On Production company: Pixar Animation Studios Release date: 6 March, 2026 Pixar's Elio failed to set box offices on fire in 2025. Can Hoppers make up for that and bring back Pixar's former glory for quirky original animations? Directed by Daniel Chong (We Bare Bears) from a screenplay by Jesse Andrews, the science-fiction comedy looks quite different from other Pixar movies. It could be helped by the featuring an older protagonist: 19-year-old animal lover Mabel Tanaka, whose uses technology to transfer her mind into a robotic beaver to join the animal world. Piper Curda, Bobby Moynihan and Jon Hamm are some of the voices. The Super Mario Galaxy Movie The Super Mario Galaxy Movie – Official Trailer - YouTube Watch On Production company: Illumination, Nintendo Release date: 3 April, 2026 The Super Mario Galaxy Movie reunites the cast from the 2023 film, with Chris Pratt as Mario alongside Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Day and Keegan-Michael Key. Some fans are concerned about the leap from Super Mario Bros to Super Mario Galaxy, which means skipping a bunch of Mario lore in Super Mario World, but we're looking forward to seeing what's in store for Bowser, whose personality is being explored more than in the games. You may like Could Stranger Things Tales from '85 be the ultimate retro cartoon? The critical 3D art trends that will impact 2026 Zootopia 2 could become Disney's biggest movie ever – here's how it was made In The Super Mario Bros. Movie, we saw King Koopa shrunken by a Mini Mushroom and imprisoned in a cage. It seems he's now been transferred into a magnificent castle where he's been 'working through his demons' and using art as a creative outlet. Daemons of the Shadow Realm Daemons of the Shadow Realm | Official Trailer 3 | Crunchyroll - YouTube Watch On Production company: Bones Film Release date: April 2026 After Fullmetal Alchemist and Silver Spoon, Hiromu Arakawa's Daemons of the Shadow Realm is hugely anticipated in the world of manga anime. The series looks set to deliver a return to high-concept fantasy storytelling. The story will explore the strength of sibling bonds, following two twins, Yuru and Asa, who were separated and tied to daemons. Arakawa has a reputation for developing complex moral themes in convincing worlds, and the upcoming animated series' looks like another perfect example. The rural world looks intriguing and mysterious, promising the perfect backdrop for a clash between ordinary lives with powerful supernatural forces. I'm hoping that Daemons of the Shadow Realm will be a modern fantasy classic. Toy Story 5 Toy Story 5 | Teaser Trailer | In Theaters June 19 - YouTube Watch On Production company: Pixar Animation Studios Release date: 19 June, 2026 Our team has been a bit torn over Toy Story 5. For many of us, the franchise feels like it's been part of our lives forever, so we have to include it in our list of animated movies to watch in 2026. Some fans have questioned the consistency of the timeline. Some also fear that the fifth installation sounds very similar to the first, but the premise of toys worried about being replaced feel more relevant than ever in this AI era. What we can agree on is that the animation in the trailer looks wonderfully polished (see the news on the release of RenderMan 27 if you want to try Pixar's rendering advances for yourself). Forgotten Island Production company: DreamWorks Release date: September 25, 2026 While Pixar has Hoppers and Disney has Hexed, Forgotten Island is DreamWorks' contender as a major studio original animated movie for 2026. We've not seen anything of this movie yet, but the concept sounds enticing, and curiously dark for a DreamWorks movie Forgotten Island will tell the story of two best friends trapped in a magical world with the only way home requiring them to forget each other forever. There's a star-studded voice cast lined up, with Lea Salonga, Dave Franco, Jenny Slate, Manny Jacinto, H.E.R. and Liza Soberano, and the movie will be directed by Joel Crawford, who did Puss in Boots. The Cat in the Hat The Cat in the Hat | Official Trailer - YouTube Watch On Production company: Warner Bros. Pictures Animation Release date: 6 November, 2026 The Cat and the Hat looks like it could be the closest Warner Bros has got yet to a Pixar-level animated movie. The Dr Seuss story will return to the big screen with a combination of stylised 2D animation and CG animation that should please fans who grew up with the book much more than that 2003 live-action movie with Mike Myers. The movie's being directed by Alessandro Carloni and Erica Rivinoja, with Bill Hader leading the voice cast and DNEG providing the animation. Some parts of the trailer remind me of the animation style of Nimona and also Max's Gremlins TV series. It looks like the style will change in the different worlds, veering towards CG realism in the real world while using cel shading in The Institute of Imagination. Hexed [Hexed] 2026년 가을 대개봉 - YouTube Watch On Production company: Walt Disney Animation Studios Release date: 25 November, 2026 We don't yet know much about Disney's Hexed, so perhaps it's a bit too early to say that it's one of the animated movies to watch in 2026, but we any new, original Disney movie is worth keeping an eye out for. All the studio has said is that Hexed will follow an awkward teenage boy and his 'Type A mom' as they discover that the lad might have magical powers. It sounds like the action will take place in the real world as well as a “secret world of magic”, both of which are turned upside down by the realisation. Disney's take on Harry Potter? We'll see, but it's notable that like Pixar's Hoppers this will see an teenage protagonist rather than a child, which could help the movie's fortunes. We're looking forward to the trailers to see what the animation style looks like. Fans of 2D animation are hoping that the movie will look like the beautifully stylised Hexed concept art that Disney released back in September, but will Disney really take a break from 3D? Upcoming animations further ahead in 2027 Further ahead, we have more exciting animation projects to look forward to in 2027. Big mainstream sequels will include Shrek 5 and Ice Age 6. Kojima Production's will bring its Death Stranding anime series to Disney+ (yes, really), and we'll also have the film that could take Indian animation global: Baahubali: The Eternal War Part 1 looks stunning with its Arcane-like art style mixing 2D and 3D animation. Want to work in animation yourself? Make sure you're familiar with the Disney principles of animation.

This year saw the release of major titles such as Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle, Chainsaw Man: Reze Arc, Scarlet, and 100 Meters, among many others . Related 7 Must-Watch Anime Movies Like Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle is huge, but it isn't the only must-watch anime movie. Posts 2 By Rei Penber As such, it is hard to imagine how 2026 could top such a phenomenal year. While 2026 doesn’t have as many big-name movies revealed yet, it will have some stunning movies that could even perhaps be considered Oscar-worthy. Puella Magi Madoka Magica: Walpurgisnacht Rising There aren’t many magical girl anime series that can compare to Puella Magi Madoka Magica . While cute on the surface, this series is actually quite dark in its genre. The anime adaptation for it was a huge success, and now, fans have a monumental movie to look forward to, which is Puella Magi Madoka Magica: Walpurgisnacht Rising . This new movie will be a sequel to the last Madoka Magica movie, Rebellion. Puella Magi Madoka Magica: Walpurgisnacht Rising will drop in February 2026 , and fans are excited to see this beloved franchise back in full force. The Apothecary Diaries Movie The Apothecary Diaries has been an absolute sensation so far . The series has gained traction all around the world, but it’s especially big in Japan right now. The Apothecary Diaries has been insanely consistent since 2023 . Every year, fans get new Apothecary Diaries content, and 2026 might just be the biggest year for the franchise yet. Not only is The Apothecary Diaries Season 3 on the way for the fans, but fans are also expecting a new movie as well. This new movie will come out in December 2026 , and it will be a brand-new original story from the creator of the series . Solo Leveling Movie Solo Leveling is a great series that has taken the world by storm. Nobody expected this short series to become as popular as it is today, especially overseas. Fans have been obsessed with Jinwoo’s story, and the studio is definitely capitalizing on that. While fans were disappointed to not get any Solo Leveling Season 3 news, the reason for its delay might just be the new Solo Leveling movie that was revealed in a production committee report . The Solo Leveling movie is anticipated to release in 2026 , but it’s not yet set in stone. What events the movie could cover is unknown, but seeing what the anime seasons have delivered so far, it can only be exciting for the fans. That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime: The Movie – Tears of the Azure Sea Isekai is quite an oversaturated genre, but among all the series featured in it, the one that has stood out from the rest is That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime . At this moment, it can safely be said that That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime is Japan’s biggest Isekai series. Related The Biggest Anime Of 2026 (So Far) 2026 is almost here, and the upcoming year should be PACKED with both massive anime sequels and newcomers. Let's go through its biggest anime. Posts 4 By Mark Sammut With such huge success, fans aren’t surprised to see it getting a huge movie soon, titled That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime: The Movie – Tears of the Azure Sea , and it’s set to drop on February 27, 2026 , in Japan. Fans are excited to see Rimuru’s next adventure on the big screen. Paris ni Saku Étoile Paris ni Saku Étoile, also known as L'étoile de Paris en fleur , is an original movie that’s most certainly going to gain great traction in Japan. The story for this movie was written by Reiko Yoshida, and fans have high expectations for what it could deliver. After all, she is the iconic mangaka who worked on Tokyo Mew Mew, one of the biggest magical girl series of all time. Not much is known about the plot of Paris ni Saku Étoile, but it will take place in Paris in the 1900s. The story follows two Japanese girls, one who wants to become a ballerina, and one whose goal is to become a painter. This movie is sure to warm the hearts of fans and it will drop on March 13, 2026. Cosmic Princess Kaguya! Stepping away from big-name franchises, Cosmic Princess Kaguya! is a new movie coming in 2026 that could definitely surprise fans with what it could deliver. This movie is going to reimagine the well-known Japanese story of The Bamboo Cutter, via Studio Colorido and Studio Chromato. This movie is about to feature some incredible music from Vocaloid Producers and will bring a fresh take on the beloved folklore story. This movie, sadly, won’t be coming to theaters. Fans can instead watch it on Netflix starting January 22, 2026.

By Sam Hargrave Posted: December 16, 2025 James Gunn's DCU recently debuted new logos for its biggest 2026 projects, Supergirl and Lanterns . DC Studios officially began marketing Supergirl at CCXP with a special booth , laying the groundwork for its imminent first trailer. In doing so, the DCU is finally on the road to its next big release in six months' time with Supergirl , which hits theaters on June 26, 2026. That will be followed later in the year with Lanterns ' HBO premiere in late summer and Clayface , which will bring its unique blend of Gotham City body horror to screens on September 11, 2026. As Warner Bros. and DC Studios begin to rev the hype engine for Supergirl , an official new logo for the June 2026 blockbuster was released online. The Kingdom Come-inspired design will be familiar to the many who caught Superman this year, with a unique shimmering coming from the text to hint at its galactic setting. DC Studios The home of the DCU also offered an alternate logo for Supergirl with a more neon, retro aesthetic, a bigger departure from James Gunn's Superman . DC Studios As the Super-Family famously wears their mutual House of El symbol across their chests, Supergirl 's logo is mostly the same as Superman 's. Still, the crest received some minor updates, such as replacing the yellow bevel with black, possibly signalling Kara Zor-El's darker personality compared to her hopeful cousin. DC Studios DC Studios may use both Supergirl logos over the coming months as part of its marketing campaign, possibly highlighting her varied personality. That said, the Superman -esque design looks to be the movie's primary logo. DC Studios Supergirl will fly into theaters on June 26, 2026, directed by Craig Gillespie with a script from Ana Nogueira, based on the Woman of Tomorrow comics. The DCU blockbuster will star Milly Alcock's Supergirl, Eve Ridley's Ruthye, Jason Momoa's Lobo, and Matthias Schoenaerts' Krem of the Yellow Hills. Next up after that will be Lanterns , which also recently received an updated logo with distinct differences from the one worn by Nathan Fillion's Guy Gardner (who will appear in the HBO series) in this summer's Superman . DC Studios Some fans are convinced that the swirls hidden in Lanterns ' new logo are hinting at a major Justice League villain . Some have theorized that the sci-fi mystery series may introduce the Centre, given James Gunn's previous promise that Lanterns will be integral to setting up the DCU's larger storyline. DC Studios The logo itself differs greatly to the one featured in 2011's Green Lantern , utilising a more bluish-green hue and not including the full outer circle. DC Lanterns enthusiasts got a brief look at what series stars Kyle Chandler and Aaron Pierre will look like suited up as Hal Jordan and John Stewart, respectively, for the eight-episode True Detective -inspired series via an HBO featurette. Also included in the teaser was a look at the show's text logo. DC The text uses a relatively standard sans-serif font and appears perhaps a bit less flashy than past logos associated with Green Lantern. The 2011 movie featured a font that evoked a sci-fi aesthetic, whereas Green Lantern: The Animated Series used a more over-the-top lettering with vibrant colors. DC Despite recently delaying the series' premiere into late summer, fans are hopeful that more news will be imminent after a trailer description revealed a fourth Green Lantern who will appear after footage was shown to select press and audiences. DC Clayface still hasn't launched its marketing campaign and may not until the spring ahead of its September 11, 2026, but the logo for the Batman villain spin-off was revealed on set . The DCU body horror was crafted by Mike Flanagan and directed by James Watkins, with Tom Rhys Harries stepping into the leading role. The DCU's Global Takeover Is Just Beginning, And I Can't Wait For now, DC Studios seems to want all eyes on Supergirl , going as far as to place a countdown in Times Square, New York City, to promote its first trailer. Fans saw over the summer that Warner Bros. pulled out all the stops to market Superman globally, and they may be hoping to carry that momentum forward into Supergirl . As Lanterns won't premiere until late Summer 2026, likely a few months after Supergirl , the two may have to split the spotlight for a period. However, complete focus may not shift to the HBO series until July and beyond, once Supergirl has been and gone, hopefully driving interest in the DCU to new heights. Of course, amongst the chaos, DC Studios is sure to put a bold push on Clayface in the hopes of attracting horror, non-superhero audiences to the DCU. With all three projects potentially having some period of overlapping marketing, 2026 could be a huge year for DC, dragging the blue brand back into the public eye. Currently, it appears that DC Studios' 2026 offerings will be limited to just those three live-action projects (two movies and one HBO series). It's possible that slate could be complemented with an animated offering later in the year ( such as the Blue Beetle sequel series ), but that remains unconfirmed for now.

Sign in to your ScreenRant account Summary Generate a summary of this story follow Follow followed Followed Like Like Thread Log in Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents: Try something different: Show me the facts Explain it like I’m 5 Give me a lighthearted recap All of the three 2025 movies that currently have a box office result of $1 billion or more all have the same origins, making their shared success this year even more noteworthy. The past few years have seen many movies cross the $1 billion threshold when it comes to their worldwide box office, with some releases seeming basically destined for this result, and some surprise successes netting this amount to keep things interesting. 2025 has been no exception, as multiple films have achieved this major milestone with their theatrical results, showing that movies can still enjoy immense theatrical success, even in an era where streaming is in many ways bigger than ever. Interestingly, 2025's current $1B+ movies all share one key thing in common, proving the potential of one often underappreciated corner of the world of cinema. 2025's 3 $1B+ Movies Are All Follow-Ups To Animated Movies Nick and Judy rowing a boat in Zootopia 2 © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures / Courtesy Everett Collection Though 2025's biggest box office hits are different in many other regards, the three films in question all share an origin of sorts, as they're all follow-ups to animated movies - with Ne Zha 2 having made $2 billion with its worldwide box office, Zootopia 2 having just become 2025's second-highest grossing movie of 2025 by reaching the $1.1 billion mark, and Lilo & Stitch coming in third for the year with its own $1 billion results. Of course, it's worth noting that, while Ne Zha 2 and Zootopia 2 are animated movies themselves that serve as direct sequels to the stories they follow up on, Lilo & Stitch is a live-action remake of the original 2002 animated Disney movie. However, all three still ultimately follow up on the original animated movies their respective series began with - which is interesting to note, even though this trend may be broken by 2025's next possible $1B movie. 2025's $1B Movie Rule May Be Broken In The Final Days Of The Year Closeup of Kiri (Sigourney Weaver) in Avatar: Fire & Ash Though 2025 is in its final days, there are still some major movies on the way for the year - and the film that looks set to be the biggest of this time period is, of course, that of the third Avatar movie, Avatar: Fire and Ash . With both previous Avatar movies having garnered well over $2 billion, it stands to reason that the third film will at absolute worst come close to these previous results, adding it to 2025's $1B+ movie roster. This would make it the outlier among 2025's existing movies that have broken the $1 billion box office mark, which is notable both in that it would show animated movie follow-ups weren't the only films that were capable of reaching this milestone in 2025 , and in that it would further reflect how impressive these $1 billion results were, since their only box office peer would be the next installment in a $5 billion movie series.

Sign in to your ScreenRant account Summary Generate a summary of this story follow Follow followed Followed Like Like Thread Log in Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents: Try something different: Show me the facts Explain it like I’m 5 Give me a lighthearted recap 2026 is scheduled to have a considerable range of monumentally exciting sci-fi movies released within it - though some of these films have more hype built up for them than others for at least the time being. Historically, sci-fi is a genre that can be explored in an astronomical assortment of ways - from gritty and grueling dystopian tales, to remarkably light-hearted romps through futuristic lands and concepts. The limitless possibilities of sci-fi stories go some way to explain why the genre also tends to consistently be one of the most popular and sought after when it comes to theatrically released films. Indeed, based on 2026's sci-fi movie lineup, it seems the year is set to be rife with criticial and commercial hits within this realm. Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die Sam Rockwell faces the camera in Good Luck Have Fun Don't Die While those lucky enough to attend the 2025 Fantastic Fest did garner an opportunity to watch a preview screening of sci-fi comedy Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die , the movie's full theatrical release is set to take place on February 13, 2026 , making it one of the first sci-fi films to release in the year. Based on Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die 's trailer - and strikingly solid 94% Rotten Tomatoes reviews from those who saw it early - it seems the film will be helping kick off the year in suitably stellar fashion. With a time travel premise that sees an unlucky inhabitant of a dystopian future journey back in time to try and save the world from its fate - recruiting a selection of seemingly random people from an LA diner in the hopes of creating a team that can protect humanity - it's clear Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die will be as entertaining as it is visually striking, making it an early must-watch for 2026. Flowervale Street Flowervale Street poster The mystery around Flowervale Street has worked in its favor in some ways when it comes to building hype around it from those who are aware of its existence. However, the relative lack of information we have about the movie does mean the main excitement around the film comes from the names that are currently attached to it, which include J.J. Abrams being one of the film's producers, and Anne Hathaway and Ewan McGregor being some of the main actors involved. Thus far, what's been teased for Flowervale Street seems to promise an exciting story, complete with at least one dinosaur and a street that's being affected by sci-fi phenomena, altering the lives of lead characters the Platt family forever - though more specifics about this installment will seemingly only become clearer closer to its scheduled August 14 release date . The Dog Stars The Dog Stars book cover Ridley Scott's history in the sci-fi genre is impossible to miss, with the likes of Alien , Blade Runner , and later The Martian cementing his reputation as someone who is able to give futuristic worlds and larger-than-life stories a grounded edge that makes them truly gripping throughout. As such, it's no surprise Scott's next sci-fi film, The Dog Stars , is one many are very excited to see release on March 27 . This is doubly true given the movie is adapting a book of the same name, which promises a suitably soulful and dramatic story of a man, his dog, and the gunman they befriended existing in a post-apocalyptic world, before one radio transmission sends the protagonists on an unexpected mission. Steven Spielberg's 2026 Movie Steven Spielberg at the London Premiere of The Thursday Murder Club John Rainford/Cover Images With Steven Spielberg being one of the biggest names in the directing sphere still decades into his career, his impending 2026 sci-fi release is naturally one that has a lot of intrigue and excitement around it - particularly since it appears details about the film may be being kept secret for as long as possible, given the name of the movie still isn't known, though its release is schedule for only months away on June 12, 2026 . Set to feature a range of talented actors - including Colman Domingo, Wyatt Russell, Emily Blunt and Colin Firth - Steven Spielberg's movie is reportedly based on an original idea from the director, and will be the first movie he's directed to hit cinemas since 2022's The Fabelmans . As such, there seems to be plenty of reasons to be excited about the film, even if we know little other than the fact it doesn't seem Steven Spielberg's sci-fi film is set to play in IMAX in 2026. Project Hail Mary Ryan Gosling in Project Hail Mary Combining a sci-fi story that is in many ways inherently suited to a big-screen adaptation - as is the case for Andy Weir's 2021 book Project Hail Mary - and some talented actors and directors seems a recipe built for success. As such, it's worth noting that Project Hail Mary is directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller - who may be most recognizable as the directors of the Spider-Verse films - and has Ryan Gosling play the movie's lead character, which all seems to suggest the film could well become one of the bigger movies of 2026 when it releases on March 20 . Project Hail Mary centers around Ryland Grace, a scientist whose primary challenge in the story comes when he finds himself on a space mission with no memory of who he is or what he was striving to do. Grace soon encounters an alien lifeform who becomes his main companion in this complex set of circumstances, with their dynamic unfolding into a truly emotional story about two very different worlds. Hunger Games: Sunrise On The Reaping The Hunger Games has seen a resurgence in popularity thanks to 2023's The Hunger Games: A Ballad Of Songbirds And Snakes , which itself built hype for fellow Hunger Games prequel Hunger Games: Sunrise On The Reaping - a film that is set to release on November 20, 2026 . Sunrise On The Reaping covers the story of Katniss' mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, and what his first Hunger Games was like - with the original books and movies providing some details regarding this matter, but leaving much of the 50th annual Hunger Games otherwise a mystery. Hunger Games: Sunrise On The Reaping 's trailer has already demonstrated how the film will balance the action and tragedies that make the series so gripping, while also delving further into the history of both Haymitch himself, and the world of Panem, shedding more light on the events of the main timeline. Supergirl Milly Alcock as Supergirl in the Superman movie While there have been a fair number of live-action DC movies over the years, the films often veer away from showing the further reaches of the comic universe, instead focusing more squarely on Earth and the events that take place on it. This makes it all the more exciting that Supergirl seems set to do just the opposite with its story, since it looks to adapt the comic run of Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, which takes place almost entirely on a range of different alien planets that are much unlike our own in many ways. Not only does this ensure Supergirl gets a more directly sci-fi-esque story - unlike Kal-El's adventures in the DCU's first movie, Superman - it also means the DC Universe's further corners can be fleshed out as early as its second film thanks to Supergirl 's June 26, 2026 release date , which has major implications for the wider franchise, too. Dune 3 Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides in Dune 2 looking off-screen Sci-fi's favorite alien worm series is set to return once more with the movie reboot's third installment, which is scheduled to debut on December 18, 2026 , and take viewers back to the world of Arrakis as Paul Atreides tries to unite its people to fight against the threat of House Harkonnen, who seek to take over the planet and its valuable resources. Now the first two installments of this series have built up a solid audience for the films and their epic story of how the cosmos are changed by the family of House Atreides forever, it seems the third film has a prime opportunity to delve into some of the biggest events in the book series - and introduce some of the bigger moral questions and plot twists that the story has to offer. Thus far, the 2020s Dune series has done a striking job of translating the sprawling sci-fi worlds of the books to life - both in its visuals and in the acting of its cast of characters - and it seems things are likely to only continue to amp up in this vital chapter of the story in every regard, painting a decidedly thrilling picture of what's to come for the franchise. The Mandalorian And Grogu Grogu eating cookies in The Mandalorian Mentioning there's hype for an upcoming Star Wars movie is perhaps as obvious as saying water is wet, even though the decades-old sci-fi world has seen some more divided reception in the past few years - which naturally bodes well for The Mandalorian and Grogu when it releases on May 22, 2026 . The Mandalorian and Grogu focusing on two of the most beloved new characters from the franchise's recent years should go some way to convince even those who have not been as keen on Star Wars' newer directions to give the film a chance, which suggests the already staggering brand appeal at play here can be capitalized on even further. With the opportunity to be a space-faring action-packed adventure, a follow-up on the aftermath of some of the biggest events in Star Wars' timeline, and a tale of an unusual found family finding their place in the galaxy, Din Djarin and Grogu's film story should theoretically have a little of something for every kind of Star Wars fan, and then some. Avengers: Doomsday Fantastic Four First Steps Post-Credits scene of Franklin Richards and Doctor Doom The sheer scope and scale teased for Avengers: Doomsday means it's inherently the biggest sci-fi movie of 2026 in terms of hype, even though the MCU has, much like Star Wars, had some more divided reception in recent months and years. The MCU has grown bigger and bigger over the course of its almost two-decade-long run, both in terms of the size of its world and stories, and in terms of its reputation. Doomsday will be the first Avengers movie since the genre-defining success of Avengers: Endgame - which sets a high bar for film in terms of what is possible for it when it releases on December 18, 2026 , but also ensures that a monumental amount of people are eagerly awaiting what this next chapter of the Avengers series holds, even if some may have their doubts about what might come next. With this next part of the MCU bringing back several major figures for the franchise - including many big Fox X-Men actors, and of course the return of Robert Downey Jr, this time playing Doctor Doom - the stage is set for a truly colossal story that pays tribute to not just every part of the MCU that came before it, but also to the wider Marvel movie world, thanks to the franchise's recent sci-fi forays into the concept of the multiverse.

And all this sets our\nsights high for the coming year. Lucky, then, the studios and directors we\nhave given our time and money to will be delivering exactly what we want. Steven Spielberg returns to the broader genre for the first time\nsince 2018’s Ready Player One, and to alien films specifically since 2008’s\nIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Ridley Scott is also\ndusting off his lenses for an adaptation of Peter Heller’s The Dog Stars. Marvel fans who have felt let down by the middling films the\nsuperhero giant has put out this decade have a new Spider-Man and Avengers\nto look forward to, and DC die-hards get to see Supergirl finally take the\nlimelight on screen again after decades spent MIA. Other big franchises getting another chance to shine include\nThe Hunger Games, Mortal Kombat, and The Mandalorian (in its silver screen\ndebut), but there is also plenty for the indie crowd, with Maggie Gyllenhaal’s gangster\nmonster movie The Bride!, and Na Hong-jin’s alien thriller Hope - his first multinational\nfeature. It’s a full roster, and suffice to say, the following 20 movies are certain to become your most anticipated sci-fi films of 2026, if they’re not\nalready. 20. The Dresden Sun VMI Worldwide UK release date: February (day TBC) Science fiction fans who are hoping The Dresden Sun might be\nan adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse 5 will be sorely disappointed\n(our day will come!), but for everyone else, Michael Ryan’s upcoming picture\npromises an exciting new entry in a rather niche genre: the sci-fi heist\nmovie. The film features converging narratives which see an expert mercenary\nwork an inside job to steal a big corporation’s most valued asset, while an\ninsurance analyst is caught in a web of corporate rivals and fraud, ending up\non the run from a military contractor. The first look trailer and those few\nimages available of The Dresden Sun so far suggest a high-tech, neon, Blade Runner\naesthetic paired with a modern corporate espionage crime thriller’s steely\nedge. It definitely doesn’t have anything like the budget of many\nof the other sci-fi flicks heading our way next year, but it’s got an\nintriguing cast in Christina Ricci, Steven Ogg (Trevor from GTA V), and Mena\nSuvari, and looks like it’s going to be a solid streaming watch.

And 2026 is positively stuffed with genre films from some of the world’s most respected filmmakers: the last time we had Steven Spielberg and Ridley Scott release a sci-fi movie in the same year was in 1982. With apologies to any superhero movies that might happen to contain sci-fi elements (no Supergirl or Avengers: Doomsday here), please enjoy this list of the most exciting genre films coming up next year. Big budgets, small budgets, comedy elements, splashes of horror – there really is something for just about everyone in the list below. Let’s begin, then, with a cautionary tale about indulging in carnal relations with a household appliance… Soulm8te – 9th January (or perhaps not…) A shot from M3GAN 2.0. No official imagery available for Soulm8te at the time of writing, readers. Credit: Universal The year gets off to a rather saucy start with this spin-off from Blumhouse’s killer robot thriller, M3GAN. Soulm8te is said to be taking the franchise into erotic territory, as a lonely widower buys a gynoid to keep him company – only for the wretched thing to start wreaking havoc. Directed by Kate Dolan and starring David Rysdahl and Lily Sullivan, it sounds like similar territory to Subservience , a 2024 thriller starring Megan Fox, and numerous other films where human-robot relations turn sour. Will it be a bigger hit than M3GAN 2.0 , which was an unexpected disappointment in 2025? Dunno m8. (Since this post was written, Universal has reportedly taken Soulm8te off its 2026 calendar, and is now shopping it to other distributors. We haven’t seen any official confirmation of this as yet, but we’ll update this list if we do.) Bulk – January and February Noah Taylor on restrained form in Bulk. Credit: Film Four. British director Ben Wheatley’s career has spanned indie drama and horror ( Down Terrace, Kill List ) and expensive thrillers ( Rebecca, Meg 2: The Trench ). Bulk sees the filmmaker explore mind-bending science fiction, albeit in a uniquely DIY fashion. Shot on a tiny budget on domestic cameras (iPhones, SVHS and the like), Bulk sees protagonist Corey Harlan (Sam Riley) head off into a bizarre, dimension-spanning odyssey that includes an enigmatic scientist (Alexandra Maria Lara) and a variety of eccentric characters played by Noah Taylor. That Harlan’s odyssey takes place almost entirely in a single nondescript house doesn’t make it any less epic. Touring UK cinemas large and small in early 2026 , Bulk is possibly the most mesmerising, unusual genre films you’ll see all year. You certainly won’t forget it in a hurry. 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple – 14th January Ralph Fiennes holds his temple in 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple. Credit: Sony. Director Nia DaCosta takes over from Danny Boyle for the next chapter in a planned 28 Years trilogy, and by all accounts, this one’s an absolute corker. Picking up the thread from 2025’s sequel, it’s another journey into a country riven by superstition, disease and territorialism. We do wonder where screenwriter Alex Garland gets his out-there ideas from. Mercy – 23rd January We’ll try to go into this one with an open mind. It’s the latest film from director Timur Bekmambetov, previously known for the flashy action thriller, Wanted , but more recently associated with a series of ‘screenlife’ thrillers. He was producer on War Of The Worlds – a version of HG Wells’ invasion text viewed entirely through a computer interface. Starring Ice Cube and a supporting cast of Amazon goods and services, it was one of the most bafflingly misguided films of 2025 . But anyway: Mercy . Starring Chris Pratt, it’s set in a Minority Report -esque future where the entire legal system has been handed over to AI. Chris Pratt plays a detective who’s accused of murdering his own wife, and has 90 minutes to convince an icy digital judge (Rebecca Ferguson) of his innocence – or face summary execution. The perplexing thing about Mercy isn’t so much the premise as the venue; Amazon MGM’s giving it a big cinema push, including a run on 3D IMAX screens. The trailer dresses the film up a bit, but it’s still mostly a single-location thriller with plot points unfolding on computer screens. We’re not sure it screams big-screen, bring-your-chums entertainment – but again, we’ll keep an open mind. Suggested product Film Stories \"I Try Not To Do Snark...\" Tee Merch £22.99 Suggested product Nicolas Cage Appreciation Coasters Merch £12.99 Cold Storage – 13th February 2026 The Last Of Us played for laughs? Quite possibly. A storage facility becomes overrun by a mind-controlling fungus in a sci-fi comedy written by David Koepp – adapted from his own novel – and directed by Jonny Campbell ( Alien Autopsy ). Georgina Campbell ( Barbarian ) and Joe Keery ( Stranger Things ) star, and there’s a role too for Liam Neeson, who’s made some, er, interesting career choices of late. That’s hardly the film’s fault, though. The trailer is filled with gore and sweary, gross-out humour, and it all looks tremendously entertaining. Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die – 20th February Another sci-fi comedy, Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die marks the return of director Gore Verbinski ( Rango , the Pirates Of The Caribbean franchise). Sam Rockwell stars as a dishevelled, oddly-dressed man who stumbles into a diner one night insisting that he’s from the future – and that he needs the customers’ help to avert a future war against machines. The film made its debut at 2025’s Fantastic Fest, where it garnered almost universally positive reviews. The supporting cast includes Zazie Beetz, Michael Pena and Juno Temple. We can’t wait. In The Blink Of An Eye – 27th February We were a bit worried about this film for a while. Finished in March 2025 , In The Blink Of An Eye sat without a release date for several months, with rumours of reshoots doing the rounds. The sci-fi drama is now making its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, meaning it’ll screen there between late January and the 1st February. From Wall-E and John Carter director Andrew Stanton, In The Blink Of An Eye is an epoch-spanning fable that takes us from humanity’s earliest days to a spacecraft 200 years in the future. The script, by Colby Day, was on the Black List of best unproduced screenplays in 2016, and it’s a terrific read : seamlessly eliding between eras and characters at various points in history, all building to a truly emotional climax. Day also wrote Spaceman, an Adam Sandler sci-fi you can find on Netflix; In The Blink Of An Eye promises to be another terrific genre piece. (Unfortunately, In The Blink Of An Eye doesn’t appear to be getting a cinema release after its festival debut; instead, Disney has opted to send it directly to its Hulu screening service on the 27th February.) The Bride! – 26th March Not connected to Guillermo del Toro’s baroque take on Frankenstein made for Netflix, The Bride is the latest film from actor turned director Maggie Gyllenhaal. It stars Jessie Buckley as a mortally injured woman revived by Anette Bening’s Dr Euphronius, while Christian Bale plays the monster and the Bride’s betrothed. Moving Mary Shelley’s Gothic novel into the roaring (19)20s, it looks like a sumptuous and beautifully-designed tragic romance. Project Hail Mary – 20th March Based on the novel by Andy Weir, Project Hail Mary sees Ryan Gosling’s unassuming science teacher blasted into space in a last-ditch effort to save humanity. The trailer gave away a bit more of the book’s events than we were expecting, so maybe avoid that if you want to go into the cinema completely cold. The adaptation’s by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, so expect plenty of humour and heart as well as Weir’s plausibly detailed science fiction. In a case of unfortunate cosmic timing, Project Hail Mary places it rather near another major sci-fi film from a director whose last big hit was also a Weir adaptation… The Dog Stars – 27th March There aren’t any images for The Dog Stars kicking around yet, so please accept this still from 1980s children’s TV show, Children Of The Dog Star. We used to quite like it. Some of Ridley Scott’s most beloved and influential movies are in the sci-fi genre – Alien, Blade Runner and The Martian (the Weir adaptation we were on about above) are all markedly different in tone, but all classics in their own way. We’re excited to see what Scott’s done with The Dog Stars, then: adapted from Peter Heller’s novel, it’s set in a future world ravaged by a pandemic. Holed up in an aircraft hangar, the two protagonists – Jacog Elordi’s pilot, Hig and Josh Brolin’s sniper, Bangley – are coaxed back into the open world by a mysterious signal. Margaret Qualley, Guy Pearce and Benedict Wong also star. Given Scott’s visual flair – even his uneven Alien prequels were often lovely to look at – this is arguably one of our most anticipated genre films of the year. The Mandalorian And Grogu – 22nd May Lucasfilm’s first Star Wars movie in seven years, The Mandalorian And Grogu takes the hit Disney+ series out for a big screen spin-off – making it the Holiday On The Buses of space fantasies. We don’t know much about the plot, and frankly, we don’t need to know: as long as director Jon Favreau delivers on the pace and spectacle, we should be in for a pulpy, entertaining evening at the pictures. Pedro Pascal, Grogu, Sigourney Weaver and Jeremy Allan White all star – the latter as the alarmingly buff son of the late Jabba. Disclosure Day – 12th June It’s an absurdly stuffed year for respected directors making genre films. And Disclosure Day could be the biggest of the lot: it’s the latest from Steven Spielberg, and a return to the UFO-based subject matter of Close Encounters Of The Third Kind. It’s written by David Koepp (see Cold Storage earlier), who previously worked with Spielberg on the adapted screenplay for Jurassic Park, and following the autobiographical drama of The Fabelmans , it’s a return to the summer blockbuster experience the filmmaker essentially invented. Emily Blunt, Josh O’Connor and Wyatt Russell star; it’s about an attempt to reveal the truth about alien intelligence to the world, and a shadowy attempt to stop it. We think. The trailer’s big on intrigue and low on plot specifics. It compels us, though. Flowervale Street – 10th August A generic picture of a dinosaur, courtesy of Public Domain Pictures. It Follows was one of the great horror movies of the 2010s, and here comes its director, David Robert Mitchell, with some sort of time-travelling IMAX thriller involving dinosaurs. Ewen McGregor and Anne Hathaway are the starriest names among the warm-blooded cast. At present, we don’t know a whole lot more about this one, either, but Mitchell is a hugely talented director of both comedy and suspense. His previous film, Under Silver Lake , was an unfairly overlooked commercial disappointment, but we thought it was an absolute keeper. As such, we’ve high hopes for Flowervale Street . Bring on the dinosaurs. The Hunger Games: Sunrise On The Reaping – 20th November Quentin Tarantino’s favourite killer contest franchise is back with another prequel, this one joining things up to the 2011 film that started it all. Hence why Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson are making a return as Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark. Expect more oppression, death and romance; Francis Lawrence has become a dab hand at making these. And as The Long Walk proved, he’s quite an underrated director, both technically and in the performances he gets from his actors. Dune: Part Three – 18th December An epic moment of epicness in Dune: Part Two. Credit: Warner Bros. The year ends with a pinch of spice courtesy of director Denis Villeneuve. Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya and the rest of the Dune crew are back for a third visit to Arrakis, and given that this chapter will sail beyond the confines of Frank Herbert’s original novel, which formed the basis for the first two movies, it’ll be fascinating to see where the Canadian filmmaker takes the saga next. Herbert’s own follow-up, Dune Messiah, had some truly wild ideas that might not translate too well onto a cinema screen, but Villeneuve’s previous adaptations were spectacularly done. Also coming up, with no release date attached: Ray Gunn, the animated sci-fi noir passion project from Brad Bird; Godzilla Minus Zero, the follow-up to instant kaiju klassic, Godzilla Minus One . You lucky, lucky people. /**/ Share this Article: ← Previous Podcast | Rocky IV (1985) and Rocky IV: Rocky Vs Drago – The Ultimate Director’s Cut (2021) Next → Rob Reiner | Filmmaker has died, at the age of 78 LATEST ISSUES Film Stories Issue 58!

Next year already has several promising new science fiction shows lined up for premieres, any one of which could become the world's new obsession. Included among these is Neuromancer , an adaptation of a novel once thought to be \"unfilmable,\" but that is now finding new life on Apple TV+. Neuromancer isn't the only exciting sci-fi series set to premiere in 2026. Joining it on next year's docket are completely original shows from popular creators, spinoffs to franchises long thought dead, and intriguing expansions of universes just now reaching for the stars. There's plenty to love about next year's sci-fi offerings, and these shows top the list of new stories to look out for. Neuromancer Is the Riskiest Sci-Fi Series of the Decade Neuromancer book cover Image via Ace Books One of Apple TV+'s most exciting series of 2026 is Neuromancer , based on William Gibson's 1984 sci-fi novel of the same name. Neuromancer combines themes of dystopian literature, a sci-fi cyberpunk aesthetic, and a countercultural premise to create one distinctly unique story that has yet to be put to screen. The upcoming series features a phenomenal cast that includes Callum Turner, Mark Strong, Emma Laird, and Peter Sarsgaard. Neuromancer is an incredibly risky sci-fi series , with many studios having tried and failed to adapt the original novel to the big screen over the last several decades. Apple TV will be the first to successfully complete an adaptation, which will hopefully live up to fans' lofty expectations. If done right, Neuromancer could become the sci-fi event of the decade. Blade Runner 2099 Expands Ridley Scott's Underrated Sci-Fi World Humans hunt replicants in Blade Runner. Image via Warner Bros Blade Runner is finally coming back, nine years after the underrated Blade Runner 2049 flopped in theaters. This time, the cult classic franchise comes to the small screen in the form of Blade Runner 2099 , a miniseries set to premiere on Amazon Prime Video next year. Blade Runner 2099 will star Michelle Yeoh as the replicant Olwen, who contemplates mortality as her life seemingly approaches its bitter end. While Prime Video has revealed very little information about the upcoming spinoff, Blade Runner 2099 will borrow more from Ridley Scott's original Blade Runner than Denis Villeneuve's sequel. The series is the third and possibly final chance for Blade Runner to finally reach the wide audience it always needed to be a success. With an extended format and plenty of goodwill, Blade Runner 2099 could finally be the project that cracks the code for the franchise's success. Lanterns Expands James Gunn's DCU John Stewart and Hal Jordan walking down the street in civilian cothes from Lanterns-1 Image via DC Studios The next project on the docket for James Gunn's new DC Cinematic Universe (DCU) is Lanterns , an upcoming HBO Max series set to explore the inner workings of the Green Lantern Corps . The series, set to premiere sometime in 2026, will follow two Green Lanterns: Hal Jordan (Kyle Chandler), an older, more seasoned hero, and John Stewart (Aaron Pierre), who is just starting out as a member of the Corps. Together, they investigate a mysterious murder in a small town on Earth. Lanterns is especially exciting for comic book fans, who have waited decades for a proper live-action adaptation of the Green Lanterns from the DC universe. The series should also appeal to non-superhero fans, as it promises to explore fun science fiction themes and carve out a distinct corner for itself in the DCU. Shows like Lanterns always push the boundary on what television sci-fi can be, making this a can't-miss sci-fi event next year. Star Trek: Starfleet Academy Does Something New With the Classic Franchise The cadets at Starfleet Academy stand at attention Image via Paramount The universe of Star Trek is always expanding with new series that explore new corners of the final frontier. Now, Star Trek: Starfleet Academy takes the time to flesh out the very institution that created every hero the franchise has ever known. The upcoming spinoff takes place at the titular Starfleet Academy, where cadets train to become officers for the next generation of explorers. The new Star Trek series will premiere on January 15, 2026. With a promising cast that includes Holly Hunter, Tig Notaro, and Robert Picardo (returning as a hologram of The Doctor from Voyager ), Starfleet Academy has the chance to be the next great entry in the long-running sci-fi franchise. It focuses on an element of Star Trek lore that has yet to be fully fleshed out, giving fans something to look forward to as the mythos of their favorite fictional universe continues to expand. Doctor Who: The War Between the Land and the Sea Promises Big Things for Sci-Fi Fans Three sea devils stand at attention in Doctor Who: The War Between the Land and the Sea Image via BBC Although the future of Doctor Who itself remains in question following the show's recent separation from Disney+, at least one spinoff is still moving forward. The War Between the Land and the Sea is a long-gestating project from the mind of franchise superstar Russell T. Davies. The upcoming five-episode miniseries follows U.N.I.T. agents as they work to prevent a full-scale war from breaking out between humanity and the waterbound \"Sea Devils.\" As the first Doctor Who spinoff in almost a decade, The War Between the Land and the Sea is an important moment in the franchise's history. When Doctor Who rebooted itself several years ago, it came with the promise that its universe would expand in multiple new spinoffs. The War Between the Land and the Sea is the first peek at what Russell T. Davies has in store for the Doctor Who franchise, but still works as a standalone story with an intriguing premise that sci-fi enthusiasts won't want to miss. Star Wars: Maul — Shadow Lord Follows The Clone Wars' Best Villain Darth Maul ignites his double-bladed lightsaber in Star Wars: The Clone Wars Image via Lucasfilm/Everett Collection The next Star Wars animation project is an exciting spinoff entitled Maul: Shadow Lord . The upcoming series is a direct follow-up to the perennial fan-favorite, Star Wars: The Clone Wars , following Darth Maul's journey after the fall of the Republic. The series will fill in the gaps of Darth Maul's Star Wars story , revealing how he ends up on Malachor during the events of Star Wars: Rebels . Darth Maul is consistently one of the most intriguing characters in the Star Wars canon, always stealing the show when he shows up in series like The Clone Wars and Rebels . Now, the franchise finally gets to focus exclusively on his character, making this one of Lucasfilm's most exciting upcoming projects. Fans of science fiction should also be excited, as Shadow Lord will also explore the vast Star Wars galaxy as it succumbs to the tyrannical rule of the Empire. The Boroughs Is a New Sci-Fi Show From the Duffer Brothers Netflix / Courtesy Everett Collection Netflix's worldwide phenomenon, Stranger Things , finally ends later this year, but its creators are already hard at work making their next television series. The Duffer Brothers' next project, The Boroughs, takes place in a seemingly normal retirement community, where a band of aging heroes must work together to foil an alien threat. Netflix has revealed very little about The Boroughs besides its premise and a release window of 2026. However, knowing the Duffer Brothers' terrific storytelling technique, it is bound to be yet another hit. With a stacked cast led by Bill Pullman, Geena Davis, Alfred Molina, Clarke Peters, Alfre Woodard, and more, The Boroughs may be Netflix's most exciting release next year. Vision Quest Follows Up on the MCU's Best Television Show Paul Bettany's White Vision looking at Wanda from Wandavision Disney+/Marvel Studios / Courtesy Everett Collection Vision Quest is a new upcoming series that takes place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The series serves as a follow-up to WandaVision and Agatha All Along , two of the franchise's most highly rated Disney+ series ever. Vision Quest will follow Paul Bettany's synthezoid hero as he struggles to reclaim his memories and find meaning in life. While the MCU has been hit-or-miss with Disney+ series, Vision Quest has everything it needs to be one of the franchise's best shows yet. With a deep, psychological premise that feels fresh and new in the oversaturated superhero genre, the upcoming series could be one of the most deeply introspective entries in the entire MCU. Although there are still many mysteries surrounding Vision Quest and its place in the MCU , it could turn out to be a surprisingly terrific sci-fi series worth watching over and over again.

Historically, sci-fi is a genre that can be explored in an astronomical assortment of ways - from gritty and grueling dystopian tales, to remarkably light-hearted romps through futuristic lands and concepts. The limitless possibilities of sci-fi stories go some way to explain why the genre also tends to consistently be one of the most popular and sought after when it comes to theatrically released films. Indeed, based on 2026's sci-fi movie lineup, it seems the year is set to be rife with criticial and commercial hits within this realm. Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die Sam Rockwell faces the camera in Good Luck Have Fun Don't Die While those lucky enough to attend the 2025 Fantastic Fest did garner an opportunity to watch a preview screening of sci-fi comedy Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die , the movie's full theatrical release is set to take place on February 13, 2026 , making it one of the first sci-fi films to release in the year. Based on Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die 's trailer - and strikingly solid 94% Rotten Tomatoes reviews from those who saw it early - it seems the film will be helping kick off the year in suitably stellar fashion. With a time travel premise that sees an unlucky inhabitant of a dystopian future journey back in time to try and save the world from its fate - recruiting a selection of seemingly random people from an LA diner in the hopes of creating a team that can protect humanity - it's clear Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die will be as entertaining as it is visually striking, making it an early must-watch for 2026. Flowervale Street Flowervale Street poster The mystery around Flowervale Street has worked in its favor in some ways when it comes to building hype around it from those who are aware of its existence. However, the relative lack of information we have about the movie does mean the main excitement around the film comes from the names that are currently attached to it, which include J.J. Abrams being one of the film's producers, and Anne Hathaway and Ewan McGregor being some of the main actors involved. Thus far, what's been teased for Flowervale Street seems to promise an exciting story, complete with at least one dinosaur and a street that's being affected by sci-fi phenomena, altering the lives of lead characters the Platt family forever - though more specifics about this installment will seemingly only become clearer closer to its scheduled August 14 release date . The Dog Stars The Dog Stars book cover Ridley Scott's history in the sci-fi genre is impossible to miss, with the likes of Alien , Blade Runner , and later The Martian cementing his reputation as someone who is able to give futuristic worlds and larger-than-life stories a grounded edge that makes them truly gripping throughout. As such, it's no surprise Scott's next sci-fi film, The Dog Stars , is one many are very excited to see release on March 27 . This is doubly true given the movie is adapting a book of the same name, which promises a suitably soulful and dramatic story of a man, his dog, and the gunman they befriended existing in a post-apocalyptic world, before one radio transmission sends the protagonists on an unexpected mission. Steven Spielberg's 2026 Movie Steven Spielberg at the London Premiere of The Thursday Murder Club John Rainford/Cover Images With Steven Spielberg being one of the biggest names in the directing sphere still decades into his career, his impending 2026 sci-fi release is naturally one that has a lot of intrigue and excitement around it - particularly since it appears details about the film may be being kept secret for as long as possible, given the name of the movie still isn't known, though its release is schedule for only months away on June 12, 2026 . Set to feature a range of talented actors - including Colman Domingo, Wyatt Russell, Emily Blunt and Colin Firth - Steven Spielberg's movie is reportedly based on an original idea from the director, and will be the first movie he's directed to hit cinemas since 2022's The Fabelmans . As such, there seems to be plenty of reasons to be excited about the film, even if we know little other than the fact it doesn't seem Steven Spielberg's sci-fi film is set to play in IMAX in 2026. Project Hail Mary Ryan Gosling in Project Hail Mary Combining a sci-fi story that is in many ways inherently suited to a big-screen adaptation - as is the case for Andy Weir's 2021 book Project Hail Mary - and some talented actors and directors seems a recipe built for success. As such, it's worth noting that Project Hail Mary is directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller - who may be most recognizable as the directors of the Spider-Verse films - and has Ryan Gosling play the movie's lead character, which all seems to suggest the film could well become one of the bigger movies of 2026 when it releases on March 20 . Project Hail Mary centers around Ryland Grace, a scientist whose primary challenge in the story comes when he finds himself on a space mission with no memory of who he is or what he was striving to do. Grace soon encounters an alien lifeform who becomes his main companion in this complex set of circumstances, with their dynamic unfolding into a truly emotional story about two very different worlds. Hunger Games: Sunrise On The Reaping The Hunger Games has seen a resurgence in popularity thanks to 2023's The Hunger Games: A Ballad Of Songbirds And Snakes , which itself built hype for fellow Hunger Games prequel Hunger Games: Sunrise On The Reaping - a film that is set to release on November 20, 2026 . Sunrise On The Reaping covers the story of Katniss' mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, and what his first Hunger Games was like - with the original books and movies providing some details regarding this matter, but leaving much of the 50th annual Hunger Games otherwise a mystery. Hunger Games: Sunrise On The Reaping 's trailer has already demonstrated how the film will balance the action and tragedies that make the series so gripping, while also delving further into the history of both Haymitch himself, and the world of Panem, shedding more light on the events of the main timeline. Supergirl Milly Alcock as Supergirl in the Superman movie While there have been a fair number of live-action DC movies over the years, the films often veer away from showing the further reaches of the comic universe, instead focusing more squarely on Earth and the events that take place on it. This makes it all the more exciting that Supergirl seems set to do just the opposite with its story, since it looks to adapt the comic run of Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, which takes place almost entirely on a range of different alien planets that are much unlike our own in many ways. Not only does this ensure Supergirl gets a more directly sci-fi-esque story - unlike Kal-El's adventures in the DCU's first movie, Superman - it also means the DC Universe's further corners can be fleshed out as early as its second film thanks to Supergirl 's June 26, 2026 release date , which has major implications for the wider franchise, too. Dune 3 Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides in Dune 2 looking off-screen Sci-fi's favorite alien worm series is set to return once more with the movie reboot's third installment, which is scheduled to debut on December 18, 2026 , and take viewers back to the world of Arrakis as Paul Atreides tries to unite its people to fight against the threat of House Harkonnen, who seek to take over the planet and its valuable resources. Now the first two installments of this series have built up a solid audience for the films and their epic story of how the cosmos are changed by the family of House Atreides forever, it seems the third film has a prime opportunity to delve into some of the biggest events in the book series - and introduce some of the bigger moral questions and plot twists that the story has to offer. Thus far, the 2020s Dune series has done a striking job of translating the sprawling sci-fi worlds of the books to life - both in its visuals and in the acting of its cast of characters - and it seems things are likely to only continue to amp up in this vital chapter of the story in every regard, painting a decidedly thrilling picture of what's to come for the franchise. The Mandalorian And Grogu Grogu eating cookies in The Mandalorian Mentioning there's hype for an upcoming Star Wars movie is perhaps as obvious as saying water is wet, even though the decades-old sci-fi world has seen some more divided reception in the past few years - which naturally bodes well for The Mandalorian and Grogu when it releases on May 22, 2026 . The Mandalorian and Grogu focusing on two of the most beloved new characters from the franchise's recent years should go some way to convince even those who have not been as keen on Star Wars' newer directions to give the film a chance, which suggests the already staggering brand appeal at play here can be capitalized on even further. With the opportunity to be a space-faring action-packed adventure, a follow-up on the aftermath of some of the biggest events in Star Wars' timeline, and a tale of an unusual found family finding their place in the galaxy, Din Djarin and Grogu's film story should theoretically have a little of something for every kind of Star Wars fan, and then some. Avengers: Doomsday Fantastic Four First Steps Post-Credits scene of Franklin Richards and Doctor Doom The sheer scope and scale teased for Avengers: Doomsday means it's inherently the biggest sci-fi movie of 2026 in terms of hype, even though the MCU has, much like Star Wars, had some more divided reception in recent months and years. The MCU has grown bigger and bigger over the course of its almost two-decade-long run, both in terms of the size of its world and stories, and in terms of its reputation. Doomsday will be the first Avengers movie since the genre-defining success of Avengers: Endgame - which sets a high bar for film in terms of what is possible for it when it releases on December 18, 2026 , but also ensures that a monumental amount of people are eagerly awaiting what this next chapter of the Avengers series holds, even if some may have their doubts about what might come next. With this next part of the MCU bringing back several major figures for the franchise - including many big Fox X-Men actors, and of course the return of Robert Downey Jr, this time playing Doctor Doom - the stage is set for a truly colossal story that pays tribute to not just every part of the MCU that came before it, but also to the wider Marvel movie world, thanks to the franchise's recent sci-fi forays into the concept of the multiverse.

And all this sets our\nsights high for the coming year. Lucky, then, the studios and directors we\nhave given our time and money to will be delivering exactly what we want. Steven Spielberg returns to the broader genre for the first time\nsince 2018’s Ready Player One, and to alien films specifically since 2008’s\nIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Ridley Scott is also\ndusting off his lenses for an adaptation of Peter Heller’s The Dog Stars. Marvel fans who have felt let down by the middling films the\nsuperhero giant has put out this decade have a new Spider-Man and Avengers\nto look forward to, and DC die-hards get to see Supergirl finally take the\nlimelight on screen again after decades spent MIA. Other big franchises getting another chance to shine include\nThe Hunger Games, Mortal Kombat, and The Mandalorian (in its silver screen\ndebut), but there is also plenty for the indie crowd, with Maggie Gyllenhaal’s gangster\nmonster movie The Bride!, and Na Hong-jin’s alien thriller Hope - his first multinational\nfeature. It’s a full roster, and suffice to say, the following 20 movies are certain to become your most anticipated sci-fi films of 2026, if they’re not\nalready. 20. The Dresden Sun VMI Worldwide UK release date: February (day TBC) Science fiction fans who are hoping The Dresden Sun might be\nan adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse 5 will be sorely disappointed\n(our day will come!), but for everyone else, Michael Ryan’s upcoming picture\npromises an exciting new entry in a rather niche genre: the sci-fi heist\nmovie. The film features converging narratives which see an expert mercenary\nwork an inside job to steal a big corporation’s most valued asset, while an\ninsurance analyst is caught in a web of corporate rivals and fraud, ending up\non the run from a military contractor. The first look trailer and those few\nimages available of The Dresden Sun so far suggest a high-tech, neon, Blade Runner\naesthetic paired with a modern corporate espionage crime thriller’s steely\nedge. It definitely doesn’t have anything like the budget of many\nof the other sci-fi flicks heading our way next year, but it’s got an\nintriguing cast in Christina Ricci, Steven Ogg (Trevor from GTA V), and Mena\nSuvari, and looks like it’s going to be a solid streaming watch.

And 2026 is positively stuffed ... 15 sci-fi films to look forward to in 2026 Killer robots, brain-controlling diseases, UFOs and more: here’s our pick of 15 sci-fi films coming up in 2026… The real world increasingly resembles a rubbish sci-fi thriller, so thank heavens that we can retreat to the safety of cinema and escapist stories about rampaging AI, over-powered corporations and totalitarian governments. And 2026 is positively stuffed with genre films from some of the world’s most respected filmmakers: the last time we had Steven Spielberg and Ridley Scott release a sci-fi movie in the same year was in 1982. With apologies to any superhero movies that might happen to contain sci-fi elements (no Supergirl or Avengers: Doomsday here), please enjoy this list of the most exciting genre films coming up next year. Big budgets, small budgets, comedy elements, splashes of horror – there really is something for just about everyone in the list below. Let’s begin, then, with a cautionary tale about indulging in carnal relations with a household appliance… Soulm8te – 9th January (or perhaps not…) A shot from M3GAN 2.0. No official imagery available for Soulm8te at the time of writing, readers. Credit: Universal The year gets off to a rather saucy start with this spin-off from Blumhouse’s killer robot thriller, M3GAN. Soulm8te is said to be taking the franchise into erotic territory, as a lonely widower buys a gynoid to keep him company – only for the wretched thing to start wreaking havoc. Directed by Kate Dolan and starring David Rysdahl and Lily Sullivan, it sounds like similar territory to Subservience , a 2024 thriller starring Megan Fox, and numerous other films where human-robot relations turn sour. Will it be a bigger hit than M3GAN 2.0 , which was an unexpected disappointment in 2025? Dunno m8. (Since this post was written, Universal has reportedly taken Soulm8te off its 2026 calendar, and is now shopping it to other distributors. We haven’t seen any official confirmation of this as yet, but we’ll update this list if we do.) Bulk – January and February Noah Taylor on restrained form in Bulk. Credit: Film Four. British director Ben Wheatley’s career has spanned indie drama and horror ( Down Terrace, Kill List ) and expensive thrillers ( Rebecca, Meg 2: The Trench ). Bulk sees the filmmaker explore mind-bending science fiction, albeit in a uniquely DIY fashion. Shot on a tiny budget on domestic cameras (iPhones, SVHS and the like), Bulk sees protagonist Corey Harlan (Sam Riley) head off into a bizarre, dimension-spanning odyssey that includes an enigmatic scientist (Alexandra Maria Lara) and a variety of eccentric characters played by Noah Taylor. That Harlan’s odyssey takes place almost entirely in a single nondescript house doesn’t make it any less epic. Touring UK cinemas large and small in early 2026 , Bulk is possibly the most mesmerising, unusual genre films you’ll see all year. You certainly won’t forget it in a hurry. 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple – 14th January Ralph Fiennes holds his temple in 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple. Credit: Sony. Director Nia DaCosta takes over from Danny Boyle for the next chapter in a planned 28 Years trilogy, and by all accounts, this one’s an absolute corker. Picking up the thread from 2025’s sequel, it’s another journey into a country riven by superstition, disease and territorialism. We do wonder where screenwriter Alex Garland gets his out-there ideas from. Mercy – 23rd January We’ll try to go into this one with an open mind. It’s the latest film from director Timur Bekmambetov, previously known for the flashy action thriller, Wanted , but more recently associated with a series of ‘screenlife’ thrillers. He was producer on War Of The Worlds – a version of HG Wells’ invasion text viewed entirely through a computer interface. Starring Ice Cube and a supporting cast of Amazon goods and services, it was one of the most bafflingly misguided films of 2025 . But anyway: Mercy . Starring Chris Pratt, it’s set in a Minority Report -esque future where the entire legal system has been handed over to AI. Chris Pratt plays a detective who’s accused of murdering his own wife, and has 90 minutes to convince an icy digital judge (Rebecca Ferguson) of his innocence – or face summary execution. The perplexing thing about Mercy isn’t so much the premise as the venue; Amazon MGM’s giving it a big cinema push, including a run on 3D IMAX screens. The trailer dresses the film up a bit, but it’s still mostly a single-location thriller with plot points unfolding on computer screens. We’re not sure it screams big-screen, bring-your-chums entertainment – but again, we’ll keep an open mind. Suggested product Nicolas Cage Appreciation Coasters Merch £12.99 Suggested product Film Stories \"I Try Not To Do Snark...\" Tee Merch £22.99 Cold Storage – 13th February 2026 The Last Of Us played for laughs? Quite possibly. A storage facility becomes overrun by a mind-controlling fungus in a sci-fi comedy written by David Koepp – adapted from his own novel – and directed by Jonny Campbell ( Alien Autopsy ). Georgina Campbell ( Barbarian ) and Joe Keery ( Stranger Things ) star, and there’s a role too for Liam Neeson, who’s made some, er, interesting career choices of late. That’s hardly the film’s fault, though. The trailer is filled with gore and sweary, gross-out humour, and it all looks tremendously entertaining. Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die – 20th February Another sci-fi comedy, Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die marks the return of director Gore Verbinski ( Rango , the Pirates Of The Caribbean franchise). Sam Rockwell stars as a dishevelled, oddly-dressed man who stumbles into a diner one night insisting that he’s from the future – and that he needs the customers’ help to avert a future war against machines. The film made its debut at 2025’s Fantastic Fest, where it garnered almost universally positive reviews. The supporting cast includes Zazie Beetz, Michael Pena and Juno Temple. We can’t wait. In The Blink Of An Eye – 27th February We were a bit worried about this film for a while. Finished in March 2025 , In The Blink Of An Eye sat without a release date for several months, with rumours of reshoots doing the rounds. The sci-fi drama is now making its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, meaning it’ll screen there between late January and the 1st February. From Wall-E and John Carter director Andrew Stanton, In The Blink Of An Eye is an epoch-spanning fable that takes us from humanity’s earliest days to a spacecraft 200 years in the future. The script, by Colby Day, was on the Black List of best unproduced screenplays in 2016, and it’s a terrific read : seamlessly eliding between eras and characters at various points in history, all building to a truly emotional climax. Day also wrote Spaceman, an Adam Sandler sci-fi you can find on Netflix; In The Blink Of An Eye promises to be another terrific genre piece. (Unfortunately, In The Blink Of An Eye doesn’t appear to be getting a cinema release after its festival debut; instead, Disney has opted to send it directly to its Hulu screening service on the 27th February.) The Bride! – 26th March Not connected to Guillermo del Toro’s baroque take on Frankenstein made for Netflix, The Bride is the latest film from actor turned director Maggie Gyllenhaal. It stars Jessie Buckley as a mortally injured woman revived by Anette Bening’s Dr Euphronius, while Christian Bale plays the monster and the Bride’s betrothed. Moving Mary Shelley’s Gothic novel into the roaring (19)20s, it looks like a sumptuous and beautifully-designed tragic romance. Project Hail Mary – 20th March Based on the novel by Andy Weir, Project Hail Mary sees Ryan Gosling’s unassuming science teacher blasted into space in a last-ditch effort to save humanity. The trailer gave away a bit more of the book’s events than we were expecting, so maybe avoid that if you want to go into the cinema completely cold. The adaptation’s by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, so expect plenty of humour and heart as well as Weir’s plausibly detailed science fiction. In a case of unfortunate cosmic timing, Project Hail Mary places it rather near another major sci-fi film from a director whose last big hit was also a Weir adaptation… The Dog Stars – 27th March There aren’t any images for The Dog Stars kicking around yet, so please accept this still from 1980s children’s TV show, Children Of The Dog Star. We used to quite like it. Some of Ridley Scott’s most beloved and influential movies are in the sci-fi genre – Alien, Blade Runner and The Martian (the Weir adaptation we were on about above) are all markedly different in tone, but all classics in their own way. We’re excited to see what Scott’s done with The Dog Stars, then: adapted from Peter Heller’s novel, it’s set in a future world ravaged by a pandemic. Holed up in an aircraft hangar, the two protagonists – Jacog Elordi’s pilot, Hig and Josh Brolin’s sniper, Bangley – are coaxed back into the open world by a mysterious signal. Margaret Qualley, Guy Pearce and Benedict Wong also star. Given Scott’s visual flair – even his uneven Alien prequels were often lovely to look at – this is arguably one of our most anticipated genre films of the year. The Mandalorian And Grogu – 22nd May Lucasfilm’s first Star Wars movie in seven years, The Mandalorian And Grogu takes the hit Disney+ series out for a big screen spin-off – making it the Holiday On The Buses of space fantasies. We don’t know much about the plot, and frankly, we don’t need to know: as long as director Jon Favreau delivers on the pace and spectacle, we should be in for a pulpy, entertaining evening at the pictures. Pedro Pascal, Grogu, Sigourney Weaver and Jeremy Allan White all star – the latter as the alarmingly buff son of the late Jabba. Disclosure Day – 12th June It’s an absurdly stuffed year for respected directors making genre films. And Disclosure Day could be the biggest of the lot: it’s the latest from Steven Spielberg, and a return to the UFO-based subject matter of Close Encounters Of The Third Kind. It’s written by David Koepp (see Cold Storage earlier), who previously worked with Spielberg on the adapted screenplay for Jurassic Park, and following the autobiographical drama of The Fabelmans , it’s a return to the summer blockbuster experience the filmmaker essentially invented. Emily Blunt, Josh O’Connor and Wyatt Russell star; it’s about an attempt to reveal the truth about alien intelligence to the world, and a shadowy attempt to stop it. We think. The trailer’s big on intrigue and low on plot specifics. It compels us, though. Flowervale Street – 10th August A generic picture of a dinosaur, courtesy of Public Domain Pictures. It Follows was one of the great horror movies of the 2010s, and here comes its director, David Robert Mitchell, with some sort of time-travelling IMAX thriller involving dinosaurs. Ewen McGregor and Anne Hathaway are the starriest names among the warm-blooded cast. At present, we don’t know a whole lot more about this one, either, but Mitchell is a hugely talented director of both comedy and suspense. His previous film, Under Silver Lake , was an unfairly overlooked commercial disappointment, but we thought it was an absolute keeper. As such, we’ve high hopes for Flowervale Street . Bring on the dinosaurs. The Hunger Games: Sunrise On The Reaping – 20th November Quentin Tarantino’s favourite killer contest franchise is back with another prequel, this one joining things up to the 2011 film that started it all. Hence why Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson are making a return as Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark. Expect more oppression, death and romance; Francis Lawrence has become a dab hand at making these. And as The Long Walk proved, he’s quite an underrated director, both technically and in the performances he gets from his actors. Dune: Part Three – 18th December An epic moment of epicness in Dune: Part Two. Credit: Warner Bros. The year ends with a pinch of spice courtesy of director Denis Villeneuve. Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya and the rest of the Dune crew are back for a third visit to Arrakis, and given that this chapter will sail beyond the confines of Frank Herbert’s original novel, which formed the basis for the first two movies, it’ll be fascinating to see where the Canadian filmmaker takes the saga next. Herbert’s own follow-up, Dune Messiah, had some truly wild ideas that might not translate too well onto a cinema screen, but Villeneuve’s previous adaptations were spectacularly done. Also coming up, with no release date attached: Ray Gunn, the animated sci-fi noir passion project from Brad Bird; Godzilla Minus Zero, the follow-up to instant kaiju klassic, Godzilla Minus One . You lucky, lucky people. /**/ Share this Article: ← Previous Podcast | Rocky IV (1985) and Rocky IV: Rocky Vs Drago – The Ultimate Director’s Cut (2021) Next → Rob Reiner | Filmmaker has died, at the age of 78 LATEST ISSUES Film Stories Issue 58!

Sign in to your ScreenRant account Summary Generate a summary of this story follow Follow followed Followed Like Like Thread Log in Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents: Try something different: Show me the facts Explain it like I’m 5 Give me a lighthearted recap 2026 is scheduled to have a considerable range of monumentally exciting sci-fi movies released within it - though some of these films have more hype built up for them than others for at least the time being. Historically, sci-fi is a genre that can be explored in an astronomical assortment of ways - from gritty and grueling dystopian tales, to remarkably light-hearted romps through futuristic lands and concepts. The limitless possibilities of sci-fi stories go some way to explain why the genre also tends to consistently be one of the most popular and sought after when it comes to theatrically released films. Indeed, based on 2026's sci-fi movie lineup, it seems the year is set to be rife with criticial and commercial hits within this realm. Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die Sam Rockwell faces the camera in Good Luck Have Fun Don't Die While those lucky enough to attend the 2025 Fantastic Fest did garner an opportunity to watch a preview screening of sci-fi comedy Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die , the movie's full theatrical release is set to take place on February 13, 2026 , making it one of the first sci-fi films to release in the year. Based on Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die 's trailer - and strikingly solid 94% Rotten Tomatoes reviews from those who saw it early - it seems the film will be helping kick off the year in suitably stellar fashion. With a time travel premise that sees an unlucky inhabitant of a dystopian future journey back in time to try and save the world from its fate - recruiting a selection of seemingly random people from an LA diner in the hopes of creating a team that can protect humanity - it's clear Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die will be as entertaining as it is visually striking, making it an early must-watch for 2026. Flowervale Street Flowervale Street poster The mystery around Flowervale Street has worked in its favor in some ways when it comes to building hype around it from those who are aware of its existence. However, the relative lack of information we have about the movie does mean the main excitement around the film comes from the names that are currently attached to it, which include J.J. Abrams being one of the film's producers, and Anne Hathaway and Ewan McGregor being some of the main actors involved. Thus far, what's been teased for Flowervale Street seems to promise an exciting story, complete with at least one dinosaur and a street that's being affected by sci-fi phenomena, altering the lives of lead characters the Platt family forever - though more specifics about this installment will seemingly only become clearer closer to its scheduled August 14 release date . The Dog Stars The Dog Stars book cover Ridley Scott's history in the sci-fi genre is impossible to miss, with the likes of Alien , Blade Runner , and later The Martian cementing his reputation as someone who is able to give futuristic worlds and larger-than-life stories a grounded edge that makes them truly gripping throughout. As such, it's no surprise Scott's next sci-fi film, The Dog Stars , is one many are very excited to see release on March 27 . This is doubly true given the movie is adapting a book of the same name, which promises a suitably soulful and dramatic story of a man, his dog, and the gunman they befriended existing in a post-apocalyptic world, before one radio transmission sends the protagonists on an unexpected mission. Steven Spielberg's 2026 Movie Steven Spielberg at the London Premiere of The Thursday Murder Club John Rainford/Cover Images With Steven Spielberg being one of the biggest names in the directing sphere still decades into his career, his impending 2026 sci-fi release is naturally one that has a lot of intrigue and excitement around it - particularly since it appears details about the film may be being kept secret for as long as possible, given the name of the movie still isn't known, though its release is schedule for only months away on June 12, 2026 . Set to feature a range of talented actors - including Colman Domingo, Wyatt Russell, Emily Blunt and Colin Firth - Steven Spielberg's movie is reportedly based on an original idea from the director, and will be the first movie he's directed to hit cinemas since 2022's The Fabelmans . As such, there seems to be plenty of reasons to be excited about the film, even if we know little other than the fact it doesn't seem Steven Spielberg's sci-fi film is set to play in IMAX in 2026. Project Hail Mary Ryan Gosling in Project Hail Mary Combining a sci-fi story that is in many ways inherently suited to a big-screen adaptation - as is the case for Andy Weir's 2021 book Project Hail Mary - and some talented actors and directors seems a recipe built for success. As such, it's worth noting that Project Hail Mary is directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller - who may be most recognizable as the directors of the Spider-Verse films - and has Ryan Gosling play the movie's lead character, which all seems to suggest the film could well become one of the bigger movies of 2026 when it releases on March 20 . Project Hail Mary centers around Ryland Grace, a scientist whose primary challenge in the story comes when he finds himself on a space mission with no memory of who he is or what he was striving to do. Grace soon encounters an alien lifeform who becomes his main companion in this complex set of circumstances, with their dynamic unfolding into a truly emotional story about two very different worlds. Hunger Games: Sunrise On The Reaping The Hunger Games has seen a resurgence in popularity thanks to 2023's The Hunger Games: A Ballad Of Songbirds And Snakes , which itself built hype for fellow Hunger Games prequel Hunger Games: Sunrise On The Reaping - a film that is set to release on November 20, 2026 . Sunrise On The Reaping covers the story of Katniss' mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, and what his first Hunger Games was like - with the original books and movies providing some details regarding this matter, but leaving much of the 50th annual Hunger Games otherwise a mystery. Hunger Games: Sunrise On The Reaping 's trailer has already demonstrated how the film will balance the action and tragedies that make the series so gripping, while also delving further into the history of both Haymitch himself, and the world of Panem, shedding more light on the events of the main timeline. Supergirl Milly Alcock as Supergirl in the Superman movie While there have been a fair number of live-action DC movies over the years, the films often veer away from showing the further reaches of the comic universe, instead focusing more squarely on Earth and the events that take place on it. This makes it all the more exciting that Supergirl seems set to do just the opposite with its story, since it looks to adapt the comic run of Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, which takes place almost entirely on a range of different alien planets that are much unlike our own in many ways. Not only does this ensure Supergirl gets a more directly sci-fi-esque story - unlike Kal-El's adventures in the DCU's first movie, Superman - it also means the DC Universe's further corners can be fleshed out as early as its second film thanks to Supergirl 's June 26, 2026 release date , which has major implications for the wider franchise, too. Dune 3 Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides in Dune 2 looking off-screen Sci-fi's favorite alien worm series is set to return once more with the movie reboot's third installment, which is scheduled to debut on December 18, 2026 , and take viewers back to the world of Arrakis as Paul Atreides tries to unite its people to fight against the threat of House Harkonnen, who seek to take over the planet and its valuable resources. Now the first two installments of this series have built up a solid audience for the films and their epic story of how the cosmos are changed by the family of House Atreides forever, it seems the third film has a prime opportunity to delve into some of the biggest events in the book series - and introduce some of the bigger moral questions and plot twists that the story has to offer. Thus far, the 2020s Dune series has done a striking job of translating the sprawling sci-fi worlds of the books to life - both in its visuals and in the acting of its cast of characters - and it seems things are likely to only continue to amp up in this vital chapter of the story in every regard, painting a decidedly thrilling picture of what's to come for the franchise. The Mandalorian And Grogu Grogu eating cookies in The Mandalorian Mentioning there's hype for an upcoming Star Wars movie is perhaps as obvious as saying water is wet, even though the decades-old sci-fi world has seen some more divided reception in the past few years - which naturally bodes well for The Mandalorian and Grogu when it releases on May 22, 2026 . The Mandalorian and Grogu focusing on two of the most beloved new characters from the franchise's recent years should go some way to convince even those who have not been as keen on Star Wars' newer directions to give the film a chance, which suggests the already staggering brand appeal at play here can be capitalized on even further. With the opportunity to be a space-faring action-packed adventure, a follow-up on the aftermath of some of the biggest events in Star Wars' timeline, and a tale of an unusual found family finding their place in the galaxy, Din Djarin and Grogu's film story should theoretically have a little of something for every kind of Star Wars fan, and then some. Avengers: Doomsday Fantastic Four First Steps Post-Credits scene of Franklin Richards and Doctor Doom The sheer scope and scale teased for Avengers: Doomsday means it's inherently the biggest sci-fi movie of 2026 in terms of hype, even though the MCU has, much like Star Wars, had some more divided reception in recent months and years. The MCU has grown bigger and bigger over the course of its almost two-decade-long run, both in terms of the size of its world and stories, and in terms of its reputation. Doomsday will be the first Avengers movie since the genre-defining success of Avengers: Endgame - which sets a high bar for film in terms of what is possible for it when it releases on December 18, 2026 , but also ensures that a monumental amount of people are eagerly awaiting what this next chapter of the Avengers series holds, even if some may have their doubts about what might come next. With this next part of the MCU bringing back several major figures for the franchise - including many big Fox X-Men actors, and of course the return of Robert Downey Jr, this time playing Doctor Doom - the stage is set for a truly colossal story that pays tribute to not just every part of the MCU that came before it, but also to the wider Marvel movie world, thanks to the franchise's recent sci-fi forays into the concept of the multiverse.

And all this sets our\nsights high for the coming year. Lucky, then, the studios and directors we\nhave given our time and money to will be delivering exactly what we want. Steven Spielberg returns to the broader genre for the first time\nsince 2018’s Ready Player One, and to alien films specifically since 2008’s\nIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Ridley Scott is also\ndusting off his lenses for an adaptation of Peter Heller’s The Dog Stars. Marvel fans who have felt let down by the middling films the\nsuperhero giant has put out this decade have a new Spider-Man and Avengers\nto look forward to, and DC die-hards get to see Supergirl finally take the\nlimelight on screen again after decades spent MIA. Other big franchises getting another chance to shine include\nThe Hunger Games, Mortal Kombat, and The Mandalorian (in its silver screen\ndebut), but there is also plenty for the indie crowd, with Maggie Gyllenhaal’s gangster\nmonster movie The Bride!, and Na Hong-jin’s alien thriller Hope - his first multinational\nfeature. It’s a full roster, and suffice to say, the following 20 movies are certain to become your most anticipated sci-fi films of 2026, if they’re not\nalready. 20. The Dresden Sun VMI Worldwide UK release date: February (day TBC) Science fiction fans who are hoping The Dresden Sun might be\nan adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse 5 will be sorely disappointed\n(our day will come!), but for everyone else, Michael Ryan’s upcoming picture\npromises an exciting new entry in a rather niche genre: the sci-fi heist\nmovie. The film features converging narratives which see an expert mercenary\nwork an inside job to steal a big corporation’s most valued asset, while an\ninsurance analyst is caught in a web of corporate rivals and fraud, ending up\non the run from a military contractor. The first look trailer and those few\nimages available of The Dresden Sun so far suggest a high-tech, neon, Blade Runner\naesthetic paired with a modern corporate espionage crime thriller’s steely\nedge. It definitely doesn’t have anything like the budget of many\nof the other sci-fi flicks heading our way next year, but it’s got an\nintriguing cast in Christina Ricci, Steven Ogg (Trevor from GTA V), and Mena\nSuvari, and looks like it’s going to be a solid streaming watch.

And 2026 is positively stuffed with genre films from some of the world’s most respected filmmakers: the last time we had Steven Spielberg and Ridley Scott release a sci-fi movie in the same year was in 1982. With apologies to any superhero movies that might happen to contain sci-fi elements (no Supergirl or Avengers: Doomsday here), please enjoy this list of the most exciting genre films coming up next year. Big budgets, small budgets, comedy elements, splashes of horror – there really is something for just about everyone in the list below. Let’s begin, then, with a cautionary tale about indulging in carnal relations with a household appliance… Soulm8te – 9th January (or perhaps not…) A shot from M3GAN 2.0. No official imagery available for Soulm8te at the time of writing, readers. Credit: Universal The year gets off to a rather saucy start with this spin-off from Blumhouse’s killer robot thriller, M3GAN. Soulm8te is said to be taking the franchise into erotic territory, as a lonely widower buys a gynoid to keep him company – only for the wretched thing to start wreaking havoc. Directed by Kate Dolan and starring David Rysdahl and Lily Sullivan, it sounds like similar territory to Subservience , a 2024 thriller starring Megan Fox, and numerous other films where human-robot relations turn sour. Will it be a bigger hit than M3GAN 2.0 , which was an unexpected disappointment in 2025? Dunno m8. (Since this post was written, Universal has reportedly taken Soulm8te off its 2026 calendar, and is now shopping it to other distributors. We haven’t seen any official confirmation of this as yet, but we’ll update this list if we do.) Bulk – January and February Noah Taylor on restrained form in Bulk. Credit: Film Four. British director Ben Wheatley’s career has spanned indie drama and horror ( Down Terrace, Kill List ) and expensive thrillers ( Rebecca, Meg 2: The Trench ). Bulk sees the filmmaker explore mind-bending science fiction, albeit in a uniquely DIY fashion. Shot on a tiny budget on domestic cameras (iPhones, SVHS and the like), Bulk sees protagonist Corey Harlan (Sam Riley) head off into a bizarre, dimension-spanning odyssey that includes an enigmatic scientist (Alexandra Maria Lara) and a variety of eccentric characters played by Noah Taylor. That Harlan’s odyssey takes place almost entirely in a single nondescript house doesn’t make it any less epic. Touring UK cinemas large and small in early 2026 , Bulk is possibly the most mesmerising, unusual genre films you’ll see all year. You certainly won’t forget it in a hurry. 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple – 14th January Ralph Fiennes holds his temple in 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple. Credit: Sony. Director Nia DaCosta takes over from Danny Boyle for the next chapter in a planned 28 Years trilogy, and by all accounts, this one’s an absolute corker. Picking up the thread from 2025’s sequel, it’s another journey into a country riven by superstition, disease and territorialism. We do wonder where screenwriter Alex Garland gets his out-there ideas from. Mercy – 23rd January We’ll try to go into this one with an open mind. It’s the latest film from director Timur Bekmambetov, previously known for the flashy action thriller, Wanted , but more recently associated with a series of ‘screenlife’ thrillers. He was producer on War Of The Worlds – a version of HG Wells’ invasion text viewed entirely through a computer interface. Starring Ice Cube and a supporting cast of Amazon goods and services, it was one of the most bafflingly misguided films of 2025 . But anyway: Mercy . Starring Chris Pratt, it’s set in a Minority Report -esque future where the entire legal system has been handed over to AI. Chris Pratt plays a detective who’s accused of murdering his own wife, and has 90 minutes to convince an icy digital judge (Rebecca Ferguson) of his innocence – or face summary execution. The perplexing thing about Mercy isn’t so much the premise as the venue; Amazon MGM’s giving it a big cinema push, including a run on 3D IMAX screens. The trailer dresses the film up a bit, but it’s still mostly a single-location thriller with plot points unfolding on computer screens. We’re not sure it screams big-screen, bring-your-chums entertainment – but again, we’ll keep an open mind. Suggested product 'Worst Timeline' Mug Merch £10.99 Suggested product Issue #55 (Deep Cover): Print Magazine Magazine £6.99 Cold Storage – 13th February 2026 The Last Of Us played for laughs? Quite possibly. A storage facility becomes overrun by a mind-controlling fungus in a sci-fi comedy written by David Koepp – adapted from his own novel – and directed by Jonny Campbell ( Alien Autopsy ). Georgina Campbell ( Barbarian ) and Joe Keery ( Stranger Things ) star, and there’s a role too for Liam Neeson, who’s made some, er, interesting career choices of late. That’s hardly the film’s fault, though. The trailer is filled with gore and sweary, gross-out humour, and it all looks tremendously entertaining. Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die – 20th February Another sci-fi comedy, Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die marks the return of director Gore Verbinski ( Rango , the Pirates Of The Caribbean franchise). Sam Rockwell stars as a dishevelled, oddly-dressed man who stumbles into a diner one night insisting that he’s from the future – and that he needs the customers’ help to avert a future war against machines. The film made its debut at 2025’s Fantastic Fest, where it garnered almost universally positive reviews. The supporting cast includes Zazie Beetz, Michael Pena and Juno Temple. We can’t wait. In The Blink Of An Eye – 27th February We were a bit worried about this film for a while. Finished in March 2025 , In The Blink Of An Eye sat without a release date for several months, with rumours of reshoots doing the rounds. The sci-fi drama is now making its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, meaning it’ll screen there between late January and the 1st February. From Wall-E and John Carter director Andrew Stanton, In The Blink Of An Eye is an epoch-spanning fable that takes us from humanity’s earliest days to a spacecraft 200 years in the future. The script, by Colby Day, was on the Black List of best unproduced screenplays in 2016, and it’s a terrific read : seamlessly eliding between eras and characters at various points in history, all building to a truly emotional climax. Day also wrote Spaceman, an Adam Sandler sci-fi you can find on Netflix; In The Blink Of An Eye promises to be another terrific genre piece. (Unfortunately, In The Blink Of An Eye doesn’t appear to be getting a cinema release after its festival debut; instead, Disney has opted to send it directly to its Hulu screening service on the 27th February.) The Bride! – 26th March Not connected to Guillermo del Toro’s baroque take on Frankenstein made for Netflix, The Bride is the latest film from actor turned director Maggie Gyllenhaal. It stars Jessie Buckley as a mortally injured woman revived by Anette Bening’s Dr Euphronius, while Christian Bale plays the monster and the Bride’s betrothed. Moving Mary Shelley’s Gothic novel into the roaring (19)20s, it looks like a sumptuous and beautifully-designed tragic romance. Project Hail Mary – 20th March Based on the novel by Andy Weir, Project Hail Mary sees Ryan Gosling’s unassuming science teacher blasted into space in a last-ditch effort to save humanity. The trailer gave away a bit more of the book’s events than we were expecting, so maybe avoid that if you want to go into the cinema completely cold. The adaptation’s by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, so expect plenty of humour and heart as well as Weir’s plausibly detailed science fiction. In a case of unfortunate cosmic timing, Project Hail Mary places it rather near another major sci-fi film from a director whose last big hit was also a Weir adaptation… The Dog Stars – 27th March There aren’t any images for The Dog Stars kicking around yet, so please accept this still from 1980s children’s TV show, Children Of The Dog Star. We used to quite like it. Some of Ridley Scott’s most beloved and influential movies are in the sci-fi genre – Alien, Blade Runner and The Martian (the Weir adaptation we were on about above) are all markedly different in tone, but all classics in their own way. We’re excited to see what Scott’s done with The Dog Stars, then: adapted from Peter Heller’s novel, it’s set in a future world ravaged by a pandemic. Holed up in an aircraft hangar, the two protagonists – Jacog Elordi’s pilot, Hig and Josh Brolin’s sniper, Bangley – are coaxed back into the open world by a mysterious signal. Margaret Qualley, Guy Pearce and Benedict Wong also star. Given Scott’s visual flair – even his uneven Alien prequels were often lovely to look at – this is arguably one of our most anticipated genre films of the year. The Mandalorian And Grogu – 22nd May Lucasfilm’s first Star Wars movie in seven years, The Mandalorian And Grogu takes the hit Disney+ series out for a big screen spin-off – making it the Holiday On The Buses of space fantasies. We don’t know much about the plot, and frankly, we don’t need to know: as long as director Jon Favreau delivers on the pace and spectacle, we should be in for a pulpy, entertaining evening at the pictures. Pedro Pascal, Grogu, Sigourney Weaver and Jeremy Allan White all star – the latter as the alarmingly buff son of the late Jabba. Disclosure Day – 12th June It’s an absurdly stuffed year for respected directors making genre films. And Disclosure Day could be the biggest of the lot: it’s the latest from Steven Spielberg, and a return to the UFO-based subject matter of Close Encounters Of The Third Kind. It’s written by David Koepp (see Cold Storage earlier), who previously worked with Spielberg on the adapted screenplay for Jurassic Park, and following the autobiographical drama of The Fabelmans , it’s a return to the summer blockbuster experience the filmmaker essentially invented. Emily Blunt, Josh O’Connor and Wyatt Russell star; it’s about an attempt to reveal the truth about alien intelligence to the world, and a shadowy attempt to stop it. We think. The trailer’s big on intrigue and low on plot specifics. It compels us, though. Flowervale Street – 10th August A generic picture of a dinosaur, courtesy of Public Domain Pictures. It Follows was one of the great horror movies of the 2010s, and here comes its director, David Robert Mitchell, with some sort of time-travelling IMAX thriller involving dinosaurs. Ewen McGregor and Anne Hathaway are the starriest names among the warm-blooded cast. At present, we don’t know a whole lot more about this one, either, but Mitchell is a hugely talented director of both comedy and suspense. His previous film, Under Silver Lake , was an unfairly overlooked commercial disappointment, but we thought it was an absolute keeper. As such, we’ve high hopes for Flowervale Street . Bring on the dinosaurs. The Hunger Games: Sunrise On The Reaping – 20th November Quentin Tarantino’s favourite killer contest franchise is back with another prequel, this one joining things up to the 2011 film that started it all. Hence why Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson are making a return as Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark. Expect more oppression, death and romance; Francis Lawrence has become a dab hand at making these. And as The Long Walk proved, he’s quite an underrated director, both technically and in the performances he gets from his actors. Dune: Part Three – 18th December An epic moment of epicness in Dune: Part Two. Credit: Warner Bros. The year ends with a pinch of spice courtesy of director Denis Villeneuve. Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya and the rest of the Dune crew are back for a third visit to Arrakis, and given that this chapter will sail beyond the confines of Frank Herbert’s original novel, which formed the basis for the first two movies, it’ll be fascinating to see where the Canadian filmmaker takes the saga next. Herbert’s own follow-up, Dune Messiah, had some truly wild ideas that might not translate too well onto a cinema screen, but Villeneuve’s previous adaptations were spectacularly done. Also coming up, with no release date attached: Ray Gunn, the animated sci-fi noir passion project from Brad Bird; Godzilla Minus Zero, the follow-up to instant kaiju klassic, Godzilla Minus One . You lucky, lucky people. /**/ Share this Article: ← Previous Podcast | Rocky IV (1985) and Rocky IV: Rocky Vs Drago – The Ultimate Director’s Cut (2021) Next → Rob Reiner | Filmmaker has died, at the age of 78 LATEST ISSUES Film Stories Issue 58!

Sign in to your CBR account Summary Generate a summary of this story follow Follow followed Followed Like Like Thread 2 Log in Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents: Try something different: Show me the facts Explain it like I’m 5 Give me a lighthearted recap 2025 has already seen some amazing movie releases, with Sinners dominating at the box office, ranking at number 11 on the list of the highest-grossing films of the year, according to Box Office Mojo . Superman and the live-action Lilo & Stitch remake have also done exceptionally well, bringing beloved characters back to the big screen. The end of the year is set to finish strong with Wicked: For Good , Avatar: Fire and Ash , and Five Nights at Freddy 's 2 set to release in November and December. Many animated films have fallen short, but the Chinese fantasy film N e Zha II is the highest-grossing film of 2025 thus far, and Disney is set to release the anticipated Zootopia 2 around Thanksgiving. 2026 is seeing the release of a variety of exciting animated films , including many sequels that are already inspiring hype in audiences who can't wait to see their favorite characters and new stories come to theaters. 10 Minions 3 Is Bound to Be Another Wacky Adventure Releasing July 1, 2026 Child Gru is intimidating one of the Minions in Minions: The Rise of Gru. Image via Illumination Minions: The Rise of Gru in 2022 made headlines not necessarily for critical reasons, but for its box office performance and an odd trend that may have been linked to its financial success. The \"gentleminions\" trend on TikTok saw several large groups of young men attending the film in suits, which seemed like a fun stunt until there were complaints about these viewers being particularly disruptive during screenings. Parents complained about not being able to enjoy the film with their kids because of littering, talking and other disturbances, which would appear again this year during A Minecraft Movie during the infamous \"chicken jockey\" scene . Minions 3 is likely not going to garner the same attention in meme culture as the trend died down once some theaters resorted to banning viewers in formal attire, but that won't stop families from attending to see the rambunctious yellow creatures get up to more mischief. Not many plot details about the film have been revealed, but Steve Carell is returning to voice Gru , and there are rumors that Alan Arkin will return as Wild Knuckles, who was prominently featured in the last film. 9 Ice Age 6 Will Hopefully Reinvigorate the Franchise Releasing December 18, 2026 Image Via 20th Century Animation With the critical bomb that was The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild , the last Ice Age film , things aren't looking so good for the franchise. With the first film being over two decades old, it may seem like audiences are tired of this franchise. However, the films have an exceptional voice cast with Ray Romano as Manny, Queen Latifah as Ellie, John Leguizamo as Sid and Simon Pegg as Buck. These are characters that audiences have grown up with and seen through catastrophic adventures. A story for the film hasn't been revealed yet , but an official poster for the film features familiar characters, including Brooke, voiced by Jessie J, and Shira, voiced by Jennifer Lopez, who are Sid and Diego's respective love interests. The poster sees Manny with his signature bulging eyes and worried expression while holding a spear, which could indicate another dangerous conflict for the found family of animals. 8 Goat is a Clever Play on Words For an Upcoming Sports Film Releasing February 13, 2026 Image Via Sony Pictures Animation Aside from a fun title and its appeal to basketball fans, Goat has an excellent creative team behind it. The film is directed by Tyree Dillihay, who is a director for the hit animated series Bob's Burgers , and Adam Rosette, who is a co-director at Sony Pictures Animation, known for his work on Orion and the Dark and The Wild Robot . Goat takes place in a world of anthropomorphic animals where a young goat named Will Harris dreams of becoming a professional basketball player despite his smaller stature. In addition to a great behind-the-scenes team, the cast is stacked with Stranger Things 's Caleb McLaughlin playing Will. His co-star, David Harbour, is also in the cast along with Nicola Coughlan, Nick Kroll, Gabrielle Union, Jenifer Lewis, Patton Oswalt and renowned basketball player Stephen Curry, who is also a producer for the film. The animation and designs for the animals are stunning, but it's to be expected from Sony Pictures Animation , whose inventive style has been impressing audiences since 2018 with Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse . 7 The Cat in the Hat Looks Like Another Inventive Dr. Seuss Story Brought to Life Releasing February 27, 2026 The Cat in the Hat poses in a car in the new movie. Image via Warner Bros. Many Dr. Seuss stories have made their way to the modern big screen in animated form, starting with Horton Hears a Who! in 2008 . Since then, Illumination has taken on the mantle, releasing The Lorax in 2012 and The Grinch in 2018. The Cat and the Hat is produced by Warner Bros. in the creative and popular 2.5D animation style, which melds hand-drawn animation with computer-generated animation. Comedian Bill Hader plays the chaotic Cat with Xochitl Gomez, Quinta Brunson, Matt Berry and Giancarlo Esposito also appearing in the cast. The film sees the Cat in the Hat , who has gained a reputation from the I.I.I.I. (Institute for the Institution of Imagination and Inspiration, LLC) for being irresponsible on his missions, facing his toughest task yet. He's tasked with cheering up two siblings who are struggling with their move to a new town. The film will bring some much-needed joy and laughter to audiences in addition to introducing Dr. Seuss's magical stories to new generations. 6 Shrek 5 Sees a New Chapter For the Ogre Family Releasing December 23, 2026 Shrek and Donkey scream in terror in Shrek 5 teaser Image via DreamWorks Animation Shrek 5 gained a massive amount of attention upon the release of its teaser earlier this year, with some Shrek fans complaining about the updated look of the characters and the changes that have been made to their design. Other fans expressed excitement over the original cast returning as well as the inclusion of Zendaya as Felicia, Shrek and Fiona's teenage daughter. The teaser is short, but it contains the same zippy and somewhat raunchy humor the series is known for , which is enough to have fans ready to be seated in theaters. As mentioned, Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz are returning as Shrek, Donkey and Fiona. Other characters like Pinocchio and the Magic Mirror make an appearance, with the Magic Mirror acting almost like a phone screen showing different edits and memes of Shrek to the horror, surprise, and excitement of the family. Major story details aren't out in the open yet, but many are theorizing that it will center around the relationship between Shrek and Felicia and her potential rebellious streak. 5 Toy Story 5 Brings the Toys Back Once Again Releasing June 19, 2026 Woody looks at Bo in Toy Story 4 Image via Pixar Since Toy Story was released in 1995, Woody, Buzz, Mr. Potato Head, Rex and the whole gang have been warming the hearts of families. Though Pixar's eclectic catalog is full of classics, there aren't any films quite like the Toy Story franchise . Woody separating from the rest of his family to be a lost toy with Bo Peep didn't sit well with all audiences at the divisive ending of Toy Story 4 , and many are wondering what the fifth film will entail. The plot will revolve around a very pertinent premise, with the toys having to compete with electronics, which have captured the attention of kids. Woody is featured in the concept art on the official Pixar website, and Tom Hanks is listed in the cast, so Woody is bound to make an appearance. Jessie, Bullseye, Hamm, Slinky and Forky, who was introduced in the last film, are also in the released pictures, so it seems like everyone's favorite characters are returning for the next installment . 4 The Legendaries Looks Like an Epic Fantasy Film Releasing January 28, 2026 Image via Pan Cinema Based on the comic book series of the same name by Patrick Sobral, The Legendaries follows a group of heroes who protect the fantastical world of Alysia. While fighting a formidable sorcerer named Darkhell, they end up breaking a magical stone that turns the powerful warriors into young children. All of humanity is cursed, and the once-revered heroes are forced into hiding as they're blamed for the unfortunate circumstances. The film sees the young heroes reunite and restore their friendship, on a quest to become the warriors they once were. The film is being directed by Guillaume Ivernel, who is known for Dragon Hunters , Spycies , and Leap! . Though The Legendaries is being produced in and being released first in France, fantasy fans worldwide can look forward to this film, as well as fans of the original series . 3 The Super Mario Bros. Movie Sequel Is Expected to Be an Amazing Follow-Up Releasing May 14, 2026 Mario and Luigi celebrating a job well done in The Super Mario Bros. Movie Image via Universal Pictures The Super Mario Bros. Movie was a colossal success in 2023, grossing $1.36 billion worldwide. Fans were ecstatic to see some of the most iconic video game characters of all time in a major motion picture. Though the astonishingly influential Nintendo games had been adapted before, in 1993, with Super Mario Bros., the film was a severe failure and has only gotten worse with age . The animated version, however, proved that retro video game movies can be spectacular with a dedicated story and voice cast. The film saw Mario, played by Chris Pratt, and Luigi, played by Charlie Day, enter the world of the Mushroom Kingdom ruled by the beautiful and fearless Princess Peach, played by Anya Taylor-Joy. The film featured tons of Easter eggs and references, and a humorous, engaging story that aligned perfectly with the games. Not much has been revealed about the sequel, but it's likely to introduce even more classic Mario characters and more threats for the brothers to face . 2 Hoppers Has a Creative Premise That May Inspire Deep Conversation Releasing March 6, 2026 Image via Pixar The teaser for Pixar's next feature, Hoppers, was released on July 16, 2025, and it's already garnered attention for its introspective look into nature. The film sees protagonist Mabel, as her brain is placed into the body of a beaver , so she can infiltrate a forest ecosystem and learn more about animals than humans thought possible . In doing so, she starts interfering with the natural order of things when she prevents a bear from eating a fellow beaver. The scientists who assisted in her transformation warn her about not disturbing nature, but Mabel seems committed to learning even more about her environment and protecting her animal friends. It seems that this film will include that signature emotional allure that many Pixar films contain . A balance of humor and heart is what the studio is known for, and Hoppers looks to invoke contemplative reactions from audiences that will leave the film making a lasting impression. 1 Wildwood Is Laika's First Film in Seven Years Releasing Sometime in 2026 Image via Laika Known for their stunning stop-motion films, including the whimsical and terrifying Coraline , Laika is finally set to deliver a new project that's sure to be nothing but spectacular.

The cast includes the voice talents of Jacob Tremblay, Carey Mulligan, Peyton Elizabeth Lee, Mahershala Ali, Maya Erskine and Charlie Day.

Superman and the live-action Lilo & Stitch remake have also done exceptionally well, bringing beloved characters back to the big screen. The end of the year is set to finish strong with Wicked: For Good , Avatar: Fire and Ash , and Five Nights at Freddy 's 2 set to release in November and December. Many animated films have fallen short, but the Chinese fantasy film N e Zha II is the highest-grossing film of 2025 thus far, and Disney is set to release the anticipated Zootopia 2 around Thanksgiving. 2026 is seeing the release of a variety of exciting animated films , including many sequels that are already inspiring hype in audiences who can't wait to see their favorite characters and new stories come to theaters. 10 Minions 3 Is Bound to Be Another Wacky Adventure Releasing July 1, 2026 Child Gru is intimidating one of the Minions in Minions: The Rise of Gru. Image via Illumination Minions: The Rise of Gru in 2022 made headlines not necessarily for critical reasons, but for its box office performance and an odd trend that may have been linked to its financial success. The \"gentleminions\" trend on TikTok saw several large groups of young men attending the film in suits, which seemed like a fun stunt until there were complaints about these viewers being particularly disruptive during screenings. Parents complained about not being able to enjoy the film with their kids because of littering, talking and other disturbances, which would appear again this year during A Minecraft Movie during the infamous \"chicken jockey\" scene . Minions 3 is likely not going to garner the same attention in meme culture as the trend died down once some theaters resorted to banning viewers in formal attire, but that won't stop families from attending to see the rambunctious yellow creatures get up to more mischief. Not many plot details about the film have been revealed, but Steve Carell is returning to voice Gru , and there are rumors that Alan Arkin will return as Wild Knuckles, who was prominently featured in the last film. 9 Ice Age 6 Will Hopefully Reinvigorate the Franchise Releasing December 18, 2026 Image Via 20th Century Animation With the critical bomb that was The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild , the last Ice Age film , things aren't looking so good for the franchise. With the first film being over two decades old, it may seem like audiences are tired of this franchise. However, the films have an exceptional voice cast with Ray Romano as Manny, Queen Latifah as Ellie, John Leguizamo as Sid and Simon Pegg as Buck. These are characters that audiences have grown up with and seen through catastrophic adventures. A story for the film hasn't been revealed yet , but an official poster for the film features familiar characters, including Brooke, voiced by Jessie J, and Shira, voiced by Jennifer Lopez, who are Sid and Diego's respective love interests. The poster sees Manny with his signature bulging eyes and worried expression while holding a spear, which could indicate another dangerous conflict for the found family of animals. 8 Goat is a Clever Play on Words For an Upcoming Sports Film Releasing February 13, 2026 Image Via Sony Pictures Animation Aside from a fun title and its appeal to basketball fans, Goat has an excellent creative team behind it. The film is directed by Tyree Dillihay, who is a director for the hit animated series Bob's Burgers , and Adam Rosette, who is a co-director at Sony Pictures Animation, known for his work on Orion and the Dark and The Wild Robot . Goat takes place in a world of anthropomorphic animals where a young goat named Will Harris dreams of becoming a professional basketball player despite his smaller stature. In addition to a great behind-the-scenes team, the cast is stacked with Stranger Things 's Caleb McLaughlin playing Will. His co-star, David Harbour, is also in the cast along with Nicola Coughlan, Nick Kroll, Gabrielle Union, Jenifer Lewis, Patton Oswalt and renowned basketball player Stephen Curry, who is also a producer for the film. The animation and designs for the animals are stunning, but it's to be expected from Sony Pictures Animation , whose inventive style has been impressing audiences since 2018 with Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse . 7 The Cat in the Hat Looks Like Another Inventive Dr. Seuss Story Brought to Life Releasing February 27, 2026 The Cat in the Hat poses in a car in the new movie.

The only thing on here is the number one choice by Laika Studios because even though they're also doing CGI, at least their stuff is always original. 2025-08-07 12:11:59 Upvote 1 Downvote Reply Copy Rob Rob Rob #HZ842145 Member since 2023-10-22 Following 0 Topics 0 Users Follow Followed 0  Followers View The Legendaries is the only one that really intrest me, but i will most likly gey draged to several others 2025-08-07 12:57:12 Upvote Downvote Reply Copy Terms Privacy Feedback Recommended After Rewatching Frozen, I Realized Everyone's Wrong About the $1.3 B Disney Movie's Most Important Song Crunchyroll Accidentally Reveals the Fate of Dragon Ball Daima's Future Christian Bale’s ‘Impeccably Made’ Drama Like ‘Pure Unfiltered Adrenaline’ Coming to Netflix Fallout Fans Get a Surprise Prime Video Update Hours Before Season 2 Drops Trending Now The Next Three Avengers: Doomsday Trailers Allegedly Will Focus On These MCU Characters Fallout Season 2 Release Date & Time: When New Episodes Drop on Prime Video Rob Reiner’s Son Officially Charged With First Degree Murder Join Our Team Our Audience About Us Press & Events Media Coverage Contact Us Follow Us Advertising Careers Terms Privacy Policies CBR is part of the Valnet Publishing Group Copyright © 2025 Valnet Inc.\n\n**9 movies and series that will make 2026 a big year for animation** (source: https://www.creativebloq.com/art/animation/9-movies-and-series-that-will-make-2026-a-big-year-for-animation)\nSummary: Nov 23, 2025 · Could 2026 be the year of the animation revival?

Although major new IPs from giants like Disney and Pixar did badly at the box office, surprise hits – like KPop Demon Hunters becoming Netflix's most-streamed show ever – demonstrate a strong appetite for animation, including among adult audiences. The good news is that animation in 2026 is looking fantastic, with a strong bill of movies and series lined up. And while some of the biggest releases are sequels, there are also some original stories coming, including from giants like Pixar, Disney and DreamWorks.

The critical 3D art trends that will impact 2026 9 animated movies and series to look out for in 2026 The Darwin Incident TVアニメ『ダーウィン事変』　第1弾PV／2026.01 OA AIR - YouTube Watch On Production company : Bellnox Films Release date : January 2026 Kicking of the best animation of 2026 in January, The Darwin Incident is a hotly anticipated series based on Shun Umezawa's award-winning manga. It follows the story of a 15-year-old \"humanzee\" hybrid called Charlie as he battles through the tribulations of US high school life and gets mixed up with an extremist eco-terrorist group that wants to take advantage of him. The series should be one of the most intellectual animations in 2026, exploring themes like identity, discrimination and moral limits as well as biotechnology. If Bellnox manages a faithful adaptation of the manga, it should be a gripping but thought-provoking animated thriller, and a great start for animated series in 2026. GOAT GOAT - Official Teaser Trailer (HD) - YouTube Watch On Production company : Columbia Pictures, Sony Pictures Animation, Unanimous Media, Modern Magic Release date : 13 February, 2026 ZooTopia 2 hits the big screen this month, but Sony Animations is hoping it can steal Disney's glory and become the GOAT of new animated movies with anthropomorphic animals. This sports comedy directed by Tyree Dillihay applies a Spider Verse-like animation style to basketball action in the tale of a goat called Will Harris who gets a shot at the big time in 'roarball', a high-intensity contact sport where only the fastest and fiercest animals can shine. With KPop Demon Hunters, Sony has boosted its reputation for animation. GOAT will show whether it can now deliver at the box office outside of the Spider-Verse.

Hoppers Hoppers | Teaser Trailer | In theaters March 6 - YouTube Watch On Production company: Pixar Animation Studios Release date: 6 March, 2026 Pixar's Elio failed to set box offices on fire in 2025. Can Hoppers make up for that and bring back Pixar's former glory for quirky original animations? Directed by Daniel Chong (We Bare Bears) from a screenplay by Jesse Andrews, the science-fiction comedy looks quite different from other Pixar movies. It could be helped by the featuring an older protagonist: 19-year-old animal lover Mabel Tanaka, whose uses technology to transfer her mind into a robotic beaver to join the animal world. Piper Curda, Bobby Moynihan and Jon Hamm are some of the voices. The Super Mario Galaxy Movie The Super Mario Galaxy Movie – Official Trailer - YouTube Watch On Production company: Illumination, Nintendo Release date: 3 April, 2026 The Super Mario Galaxy Movie reunites the cast from the 2023 film, with Chris Pratt as Mario alongside Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Day and Keegan-Michael Key. Some fans are concerned about the leap from Super Mario Bros to Super Mario Galaxy, which means skipping a bunch of Mario lore in Super Mario World, but we're looking forward to seeing what's in store for Bowser, whose personality is being explored more than in the games. You may like Could Stranger Things Tales from '85 be the ultimate retro cartoon? The critical 3D art trends that will impact 2026 Zootopia 2 could become Disney's biggest movie ever – here's how it was made In The Super Mario Bros. Movie, we saw King Koopa shrunken by a Mini Mushroom and imprisoned in a cage. It seems he's now been transferred into a magnificent castle where he's been 'working through his demons' and using art as a creative outlet. Daemons of the Shadow Realm Daemons of the Shadow Realm | Official Trailer 3 | Crunchyroll - YouTube Watch On Production company: Bones Film Release date: April 2026 After Fullmetal Alchemist and Silver Spoon, Hiromu Arakawa's Daemons of the Shadow Realm is hugely anticipated in the world of manga anime. The series looks set to deliver a return to high-concept fantasy storytelling. The story will explore the strength of sibling bonds, following two twins, Yuru and Asa, who were separated and tied to daemons. Arakawa has a reputation for developing complex moral themes in convincing worlds, and the upcoming animated series' looks like another perfect example. The rural world looks intriguing and mysterious, promising the perfect backdrop for a clash between ordinary lives with powerful supernatural forces. I'm hoping that Daemons of the Shadow Realm will be a modern fantasy classic. Toy Story 5 Toy Story 5 | Teaser Trailer | In Theaters June 19 - YouTube Watch On Production company: Pixar Animation Studios Release date: 19 June, 2026 Our team has been a bit torn over Toy Story 5. For many of us, the franchise feels like it's been part of our lives forever, so we have to include it in our list of animated movies to watch in 2026. Some fans have questioned the consistency of the timeline. Some also fear that the fifth installation sounds very similar to the first, but the premise of toys worried about being replaced feel more relevant than ever in this AI era. What we can agree on is that the animation in the trailer looks wonderfully polished (see the news on the release of RenderMan 27 if you want to try Pixar's rendering advances for yourself). Forgotten Island Production company: DreamWorks Release date: September 25, 2026 While Pixar has Hoppers and Disney has Hexed, Forgotten Island is DreamWorks' contender as a major studio original animated movie for 2026. We've not seen anything of this movie yet, but the concept sounds enticing, and curiously dark for a DreamWorks movie Forgotten Island will tell the story of two best friends trapped in a magical world with the only way home requiring them to forget each other forever. There's a star-studded voice cast lined up, with Lea Salonga, Dave Franco, Jenny Slate, Manny Jacinto, H.E.R. and Liza Soberano, and the movie will be directed by Joel Crawford, who did Puss in Boots. The Cat in the Hat The Cat in the Hat | Official Trailer - YouTube Watch On Production company: Warner Bros. Pictures Animation Release date: 6 November, 2026 The Cat and the Hat looks like it could be the closest Warner Bros has got yet to a Pixar-level animated movie. The Dr Seuss story will return to the big screen with a combination of stylised 2D animation and CG animation that should please fans who grew up with the book much more than that 2003 live-action movie with Mike Myers. The movie's being directed by Alessandro Carloni and Erica Rivinoja, with Bill Hader leading the voice cast and DNEG providing the animation. Some parts of the trailer remind me of the animation style of Nimona and also Max's Gremlins TV series. It looks like the style will change in the different worlds, veering towards CG realism in the real world while using cel shading in The Institute of Imagination. Hexed [Hexed] 2026년 가을 대개봉 - YouTube Watch On Production company: Walt Disney Animation Studios Release date: 25 November, 2026 We don't yet know much about Disney's Hexed, so perhaps it's a bit too early to say that it's one of the animated movies to watch in 2026, but we any new, original Disney movie is worth keeping an eye out for. All the studio has said is that Hexed will follow an awkward teenage boy and his 'Type A mom' as they discover that the lad might have magical powers. It sounds like the action will take place in the real world as well as a “secret world of magic”, both of which are turned upside down by the realisation. Disney's take on Harry Potter? We'll see, but it's notable that like Pixar's Hoppers this will see an teenage protagonist rather than a child, which could help the movie's fortunes. We're looking forward to the trailers to see what the animation style looks like. Fans of 2D animation are hoping that the movie will look like the beautifully stylised Hexed concept art that Disney released back in September, but will Disney really take a break from 3D? Upcoming animations further ahead in 2027 Further ahead, we have more exciting animation projects to look forward to in 2027. Big mainstream sequels will include Shrek 5 and Ice Age 6. Kojima Production's will bring its Death Stranding anime series to Disney+ (yes, really), and we'll also have the film that could take Indian animation global: Baahubali: The Eternal War Part 1 looks stunning with its Arcane-like art style mixing 2D and 3D animation. Want to work in animation yourself? Make sure you're familiar with the Disney principles of animation.

Sign in to your CBR account Summary Generate a summary of this story follow Follow followed Followed Like Like Thread 2 Log in Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents: Try something different: Show me the facts Explain it like I’m 5 Give me a lighthearted recap 2025 has already seen some amazing movie releases, with Sinners dominating at the box office, ranking at number 11 on the list of the highest-grossing films of the year, according to Box Office Mojo . Superman and the live-action Lilo & Stitch remake have also done exceptionally well, bringing beloved characters back to the big screen. The end of the year is set to finish strong with Wicked: For Good , Avatar: Fire and Ash , and Five Nights at Freddy 's 2 set to release in November and December. Many animated films have fallen short, but the Chinese fantasy film N e Zha II is the highest-grossing film of 2025 thus far, and Disney is set to release the anticipated Zootopia 2 around Thanksgiving. 2026 is seeing the release of a variety of exciting animated films , including many sequels that are already inspiring hype in audiences who can't wait to see their favorite characters and new stories come to theaters. 10 Minions 3 Is Bound to Be Another Wacky Adventure Releasing July 1, 2026 Child Gru is intimidating one of the Minions in Minions: The Rise of Gru. Image via Illumination Minions: The Rise of Gru in 2022 made headlines not necessarily for critical reasons, but for its box office performance and an odd trend that may have been linked to its financial success. The \"gentleminions\" trend on TikTok saw several large groups of young men attending the film in suits, which seemed like a fun stunt until there were complaints about these viewers being particularly disruptive during screenings. Parents complained about not being able to enjoy the film with their kids because of littering, talking and other disturbances, which would appear again this year during A Minecraft Movie during the infamous \"chicken jockey\" scene . Minions 3 is likely not going to garner the same attention in meme culture as the trend died down once some theaters resorted to banning viewers in formal attire, but that won't stop families from attending to see the rambunctious yellow creatures get up to more mischief. Not many plot details about the film have been revealed, but Steve Carell is returning to voice Gru , and there are rumors that Alan Arkin will return as Wild Knuckles, who was prominently featured in the last film. 9 Ice Age 6 Will Hopefully Reinvigorate the Franchise Releasing December 18, 2026 Image Via 20th Century Animation With the critical bomb that was The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild , the last Ice Age film , things aren't looking so good for the franchise. With the first film being over two decades old, it may seem like audiences are tired of this franchise. However, the films have an exceptional voice cast with Ray Romano as Manny, Queen Latifah as Ellie, John Leguizamo as Sid and Simon Pegg as Buck. These are characters that audiences have grown up with and seen through catastrophic adventures. A story for the film hasn't been revealed yet , but an official poster for the film features familiar characters, including Brooke, voiced by Jessie J, and Shira, voiced by Jennifer Lopez, who are Sid and Diego's respective love interests. The poster sees Manny with his signature bulging eyes and worried expression while holding a spear, which could indicate another dangerous conflict for the found family of animals. 8 Goat is a Clever Play on Words For an Upcoming Sports Film Releasing February 13, 2026 Image Via Sony Pictures Animation Aside from a fun title and its appeal to basketball fans, Goat has an excellent creative team behind it. The film is directed by Tyree Dillihay, who is a director for the hit animated series Bob's Burgers , and Adam Rosette, who is a co-director at Sony Pictures Animation, known for his work on Orion and the Dark and The Wild Robot . Goat takes place in a world of anthropomorphic animals where a young goat named Will Harris dreams of becoming a professional basketball player despite his smaller stature. In addition to a great behind-the-scenes team, the cast is stacked with Stranger Things 's Caleb McLaughlin playing Will. His co-star, David Harbour, is also in the cast along with Nicola Coughlan, Nick Kroll, Gabrielle Union, Jenifer Lewis, Patton Oswalt and renowned basketball player Stephen Curry, who is also a producer for the film. The animation and designs for the animals are stunning, but it's to be expected from Sony Pictures Animation , whose inventive style has been impressing audiences since 2018 with Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse . 7 The Cat in the Hat Looks Like Another Inventive Dr. Seuss Story Brought to Life Releasing February 27, 2026 The Cat in the Hat poses in a car in the new movie. Image via Warner Bros. Many Dr. Seuss stories have made their way to the modern big screen in animated form, starting with Horton Hears a Who! in 2008 . Since then, Illumination has taken on the mantle, releasing The Lorax in 2012 and The Grinch in 2018. The Cat and the Hat is produced by Warner Bros. in the creative and popular 2.5D animation style, which melds hand-drawn animation with computer-generated animation. Comedian Bill Hader plays the chaotic Cat with Xochitl Gomez, Quinta Brunson, Matt Berry and Giancarlo Esposito also appearing in the cast. The film sees the Cat in the Hat , who has gained a reputation from the I.I.I.I. (Institute for the Institution of Imagination and Inspiration, LLC) for being irresponsible on his missions, facing his toughest task yet. He's tasked with cheering up two siblings who are struggling with their move to a new town. The film will bring some much-needed joy and laughter to audiences in addition to introducing Dr. Seuss's magical stories to new generations. 6 Shrek 5 Sees a New Chapter For the Ogre Family Releasing December 23, 2026 Shrek and Donkey scream in terror in Shrek 5 teaser Image via DreamWorks Animation Shrek 5 gained a massive amount of attention upon the release of its teaser earlier this year, with some Shrek fans complaining about the updated look of the characters and the changes that have been made to their design. Other fans expressed excitement over the original cast returning as well as the inclusion of Zendaya as Felicia, Shrek and Fiona's teenage daughter. The teaser is short, but it contains the same zippy and somewhat raunchy humor the series is known for , which is enough to have fans ready to be seated in theaters. As mentioned, Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz are returning as Shrek, Donkey and Fiona. Other characters like Pinocchio and the Magic Mirror make an appearance, with the Magic Mirror acting almost like a phone screen showing different edits and memes of Shrek to the horror, surprise, and excitement of the family. Major story details aren't out in the open yet, but many are theorizing that it will center around the relationship between Shrek and Felicia and her potential rebellious streak. 5 Toy Story 5 Brings the Toys Back Once Again Releasing June 19, 2026 Woody looks at Bo in Toy Story 4 Image via Pixar Since Toy Story was released in 1995, Woody, Buzz, Mr. Potato Head, Rex and the whole gang have been warming the hearts of families. Though Pixar's eclectic catalog is full of classics, there aren't any films quite like the Toy Story franchise . Woody separating from the rest of his family to be a lost toy with Bo Peep didn't sit well with all audiences at the divisive ending of Toy Story 4 , and many are wondering what the fifth film will entail. The plot will revolve around a very pertinent premise, with the toys having to compete with electronics, which have captured the attention of kids. Woody is featured in the concept art on the official Pixar website, and Tom Hanks is listed in the cast, so Woody is bound to make an appearance. Jessie, Bullseye, Hamm, Slinky and Forky, who was introduced in the last film, are also in the released pictures, so it seems like everyone's favorite characters are returning for the next installment . 4 The Legendaries Looks Like an Epic Fantasy Film Releasing January 28, 2026 Image via Pan Cinema Based on the comic book series of the same name by Patrick Sobral, The Legendaries follows a group of heroes who protect the fantastical world of Alysia. While fighting a formidable sorcerer named Darkhell, they end up breaking a magical stone that turns the powerful warriors into young children. All of humanity is cursed, and the once-revered heroes are forced into hiding as they're blamed for the unfortunate circumstances. The film sees the young heroes reunite and restore their friendship, on a quest to become the warriors they once were. The film is being directed by Guillaume Ivernel, who is known for Dragon Hunters , Spycies , and Leap! . Though The Legendaries is being produced in and being released first in France, fantasy fans worldwide can look forward to this film, as well as fans of the original series . 3 The Super Mario Bros. Movie Sequel Is Expected to Be an Amazing Follow-Up Releasing May 14, 2026 Mario and Luigi celebrating a job well done in The Super Mario Bros. Movie Image via Universal Pictures The Super Mario Bros. Movie was a colossal success in 2023, grossing $1.36 billion worldwide. Fans were ecstatic to see some of the most iconic video game characters of all time in a major motion picture. Though the astonishingly influential Nintendo games had been adapted before, in 1993, with Super Mario Bros., the film was a severe failure and has only gotten worse with age . The animated version, however, proved that retro video game movies can be spectacular with a dedicated story and voice cast. The film saw Mario, played by Chris Pratt, and Luigi, played by Charlie Day, enter the world of the Mushroom Kingdom ruled by the beautiful and fearless Princess Peach, played by Anya Taylor-Joy. The film featured tons of Easter eggs and references, and a humorous, engaging story that aligned perfectly with the games. Not much has been revealed about the sequel, but it's likely to introduce even more classic Mario characters and more threats for the brothers to face . 2 Hoppers Has a Creative Premise That May Inspire Deep Conversation Releasing March 6, 2026 Image via Pixar The teaser for Pixar's next feature, Hoppers, was released on July 16, 2025, and it's already garnered attention for its introspective look into nature. The film sees protagonist Mabel, as her brain is placed into the body of a beaver , so she can infiltrate a forest ecosystem and learn more about animals than humans thought possible . In doing so, she starts interfering with the natural order of things when she prevents a bear from eating a fellow beaver. The scientists who assisted in her transformation warn her about not disturbing nature, but Mabel seems committed to learning even more about her environment and protecting her animal friends. It seems that this film will include that signature emotional allure that many Pixar films contain . A balance of humor and heart is what the studio is known for, and Hoppers looks to invoke contemplative reactions from audiences that will leave the film making a lasting impression. 1 Wildwood Is Laika's First Film in Seven Years Releasing Sometime in 2026 Image via Laika Known for their stunning stop-motion films, including the whimsical and terrifying Coraline , Laika is finally set to deliver a new project that's sure to be nothing but spectacular. Wildwood , based on the novel by Colin Meloy , the lead singer and songwriter for the rock band The Decemberists, follows the hero protagonist Prue McKeel, whose younger brother is kidnapped and taken into the depths of a strange forest. The film is directed by Travis Knight, who directed another mystical Laika film, Kubo and the Two Strings . The screenplay is written by Chris Butler, who directed Laika's last film, Missing Link . The cast includes the voice talents of Jacob Tremblay, Carey Mulligan, Peyton Elizabeth Lee, Mahershala Ali, Maya Erskine and Charlie Day. With such a focus on winding woods, strange creatures and family bonds, Laika is the perfect studio to develop this story and is sure to entrance audiences with stellar stop-motion , immersing them in an expansive world that won't be easily forgotten.

Personally I can't get that excited to see another Ice Age movie or even the Minions. An interestingly, while a couple of these look really good, I can't help but notice there's not a single traditionally animated film on the list. We produce some really good stuff here in the US but man it troubles me that this country has all but abandoned traditional animation. CGI is great but it shouldn't be the only thing out there. The only thing on here is the number one choice by Laika Studios because even though they're also doing CGI, at least their stuff is always original. 2025-08-07 12:11:59 Upvote 1 Downvote Reply Copy Rob Rob Rob #HZ842145 Member since 2023-10-22 Following 0 Topics 0 Users Follow Followed 0  Followers View The Legendaries is the only one that really intrest me, but i will most likly gey draged to several others 2025-08-07 12:57:12 Upvote Downvote Reply Copy Terms Privacy Feedback Recommended After Rewatching Frozen, I Realized Everyone's Wrong About the $1.3 B Disney Movie's Most Important Song March 2026 Will Be a Great Month for Solo Leveling Fans Christopher Nolan’s The Odyssey New Look Reveals Batman Actor in Major Role The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Struggle With Their New Familiar Foe in an Advance Preview Trending Now Marvel Studios Set a Dismal Box Office Record This Year (And One Stat Will Blow Your Mind) 17 Years Later, The Greatest Sci-Fi RPG of All Time Is 100% Untouchable Baldur's Gate 3 Devs Using AI for Next Game (& Gamers Are Salty) Join Our Team Our Audience About Us Press & Events Media Coverage Contact Us Follow Us Advertising Careers Terms Privacy Policies CBR is part of the Valnet Publishing Group Copyright © 2025 Valnet Inc.\n\n**9 movies and series that will make 2026 a big year for animation** (source: https://www.creativebloq.com/art/animation/9-movies-and-series-that-will-make-2026-a-big-year-for-animation)\nSummary: The good news is that animation in 2026 is looking fantastic, with a strong bill of movies and series lined up.

Although major new IPs from giants like Disney and Pixar did badly at the box office, surprise hits – like KPop Demon Hunters becoming Netflix's most-streamed show ever – demonstrate a strong appetite for animation, including among adult audiences. The good news is that animation in 2026 is looking fantastic, with a strong bill of movies and series lined up. And while some of the biggest releases are sequels, there are also some original stories coming, including from giants like Pixar, Disney and DreamWorks. Could 2026 be the year of the animation revival? Here's our pick of the best animated movies and series to look out for throughout the coming year. If you're inspired to start your own animation journey, see our pick of the best animation software and the best laptops for animation.

The critical 3D art trends that will impact 2026 9 animated movies and series to look out for in 2026 The Darwin Incident TVアニメ『ダーウィン事変』　第1弾PV／2026.01 OA AIR - YouTube Watch On Production company : Bellnox Films Release date : January 2026 Kicking of the best animation of 2026 in January, The Darwin Incident is a hotly anticipated series based on Shun Umezawa's award-winning manga. It follows the story of a 15-year-old \"humanzee\" hybrid called Charlie as he battles through the tribulations of US high school life and gets mixed up with an extremist eco-terrorist group that wants to take advantage of him. The series should be one of the most intellectual animations in 2026, exploring themes like identity, discrimination and moral limits as well as biotechnology. If Bellnox manages a faithful adaptation of the manga, it should be a gripping but thought-provoking animated thriller, and a great start for animated series in 2026. GOAT GOAT - Official Teaser Trailer (HD) - YouTube Watch On Production company : Columbia Pictures, Sony Pictures Animation, Unanimous Media, Modern Magic Release date : 13 February, 2026 ZooTopia 2 hits the big screen this month, but Sony Animations is hoping it can steal Disney's glory and become the GOAT of new animated movies with anthropomorphic animals. This sports comedy directed by Tyree Dillihay applies a Spider Verse-like animation style to basketball action in the tale of a goat called Will Harris who gets a shot at the big time in 'roarball', a high-intensity contact sport where only the fastest and fiercest animals can shine. With KPop Demon Hunters, Sony has boosted its reputation for animation. GOAT will show whether it can now deliver at the box office outside of the Spider-Verse.

Hoppers Hoppers | Teaser Trailer | In theaters March 6 - YouTube Watch On Production company: Pixar Animation Studios Release date: 6 March, 2026 Pixar's Elio failed to set box offices on fire in 2025. Can Hoppers make up for that and bring back Pixar's former glory for quirky original animations? Directed by Daniel Chong (We Bare Bears) from a screenplay by Jesse Andrews, the science-fiction comedy looks quite different from other Pixar movies. It could be helped by the featuring an older protagonist: 19-year-old animal lover Mabel Tanaka, whose uses technology to transfer her mind into a robotic beaver to join the animal world. Piper Curda, Bobby Moynihan and Jon Hamm are some of the voices. The Super Mario Galaxy Movie The Super Mario Galaxy Movie – Official Trailer - YouTube Watch On Production company: Illumination, Nintendo Release date: 3 April, 2026 The Super Mario Galaxy Movie reunites the cast from the 2023 film, with Chris Pratt as Mario alongside Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Day and Keegan-Michael Key. Some fans are concerned about the leap from Super Mario Bros to Super Mario Galaxy, which means skipping a bunch of Mario lore in Super Mario World, but we're looking forward to seeing what's in store for Bowser, whose personality is being explored more than in the games. You may like Could Stranger Things Tales from '85 be the ultimate retro cartoon? The critical 3D art trends that will impact 2026 Zootopia 2 could become Disney's biggest movie ever – here's how it was made In The Super Mario Bros. Movie, we saw King Koopa shrunken by a Mini Mushroom and imprisoned in a cage. It seems he's now been transferred into a magnificent castle where he's been 'working through his demons' and using art as a creative outlet. Daemons of the Shadow Realm Daemons of the Shadow Realm | Official Trailer 3 | Crunchyroll - YouTube Watch On Production company: Bones Film Release date: April 2026 After Fullmetal Alchemist and Silver Spoon, Hiromu Arakawa's Daemons of the Shadow Realm is hugely anticipated in the world of manga anime. The series looks set to deliver a return to high-concept fantasy storytelling. The story will explore the strength of sibling bonds, following two twins, Yuru and Asa, who were separated and tied to daemons. Arakawa has a reputation for developing complex moral themes in convincing worlds, and the upcoming animated series' looks like another perfect example. The rural world looks intriguing and mysterious, promising the perfect backdrop for a clash between ordinary lives with powerful supernatural forces. I'm hoping that Daemons of the Shadow Realm will be a modern fantasy classic. Toy Story 5 Toy Story 5 | Teaser Trailer | In Theaters June 19 - YouTube Watch On Production company: Pixar Animation Studios Release date: 19 June, 2026 Our team has been a bit torn over Toy Story 5. For many of us, the franchise feels like it's been part of our lives forever, so we have to include it in our list of animated movies to watch in 2026. Some fans have questioned the consistency of the timeline. Some also fear that the fifth installation sounds very similar to the first, but the premise of toys worried about being replaced feel more relevant than ever in this AI era. What we can agree on is that the animation in the trailer looks wonderfully polished (see the news on the release of RenderMan 27 if you want to try Pixar's rendering advances for yourself). Forgotten Island Production company: DreamWorks Release date: September 25, 2026 While Pixar has Hoppers and Disney has Hexed, Forgotten Island is DreamWorks' contender as a major studio original animated movie for 2026. We've not seen anything of this movie yet, but the concept sounds enticing, and curiously dark for a DreamWorks movie Forgotten Island will tell the story of two best friends trapped in a magical world with the only way home requiring them to forget each other forever. There's a star-studded voice cast lined up, with Lea Salonga, Dave Franco, Jenny Slate, Manny Jacinto, H.E.R. and Liza Soberano, and the movie will be directed by Joel Crawford, who did Puss in Boots. The Cat in the Hat The Cat in the Hat | Official Trailer - YouTube Watch On Production company: Warner Bros. Pictures Animation Release date: 6 November, 2026 The Cat and the Hat looks like it could be the closest Warner Bros has got yet to a Pixar-level animated movie. The Dr Seuss story will return to the big screen with a combination of stylised 2D animation and CG animation that should please fans who grew up with the book much more than that 2003 live-action movie with Mike Myers. The movie's being directed by Alessandro Carloni and Erica Rivinoja, with Bill Hader leading the voice cast and DNEG providing the animation. Some parts of the trailer remind me of the animation style of Nimona and also Max's Gremlins TV series. It looks like the style will change in the different worlds, veering towards CG realism in the real world while using cel shading in The Institute of Imagination. Hexed [Hexed] 2026년 가을 대개봉 - YouTube Watch On Production company: Walt Disney Animation Studios Release date: 25 November, 2026 We don't yet know much about Disney's Hexed, so perhaps it's a bit too early to say that it's one of the animated movies to watch in 2026, but we any new, original Disney movie is worth keeping an eye out for. All the studio has said is that Hexed will follow an awkward teenage boy and his 'Type A mom' as they discover that the lad might have magical powers. It sounds like the action will take place in the real world as well as a “secret world of magic”, both of which are turned upside down by the realisation. Disney's take on Harry Potter? We'll see, but it's notable that like Pixar's Hoppers this will see an teenage protagonist rather than a child, which could help the movie's fortunes. We're looking forward to the trailers to see what the animation style looks like. Fans of 2D animation are hoping that the movie will look like the beautifully stylised Hexed concept art that Disney released back in September, but will Disney really take a break from 3D? Upcoming animations further ahead in 2027 Further ahead, we have more exciting animation projects to look forward to in 2027. Big mainstream sequels will include Shrek 5 and Ice Age 6. Kojima Production's will bring its Death Stranding anime series to Disney+ (yes, really), and we'll also have the film that could take Indian animation global: Baahubali: The Eternal War Part 1 looks stunning with its Arcane-like art style mixing 2D and 3D animation. Want to work in animation yourself? Make sure you're familiar with the Disney principles of animation.

This year saw the release of major titles such as Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle, Chainsaw Man: Reze Arc, Scarlet, and 100 Meters, among many others . Related 7 Must-Watch Anime Movies Like Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle is huge, but it isn't the only must-watch anime movie. Posts 2 By Rei Penber As such, it is hard to imagine how 2026 could top such a phenomenal year. While 2026 doesn’t have as many big-name movies revealed yet, it will have some stunning movies that could even perhaps be considered Oscar-worthy. Puella Magi Madoka Magica: Walpurgisnacht Rising There aren’t many magical girl anime series that can compare to Puella Magi Madoka Magica . While cute on the surface, this series is actually quite dark in its genre. The anime adaptation for it was a huge success, and now, fans have a monumental movie to look forward to, which is Puella Magi Madoka Magica: Walpurgisnacht Rising . This new movie will be a sequel to the last Madoka Magica movie, Rebellion. Puella Magi Madoka Magica: Walpurgisnacht Rising will drop in February 2026 , and fans are excited to see this beloved franchise back in full force. The Apothecary Diaries Movie The Apothecary Diaries has been an absolute sensation so far . The series has gained traction all around the world, but it’s especially big in Japan right now. The Apothecary Diaries has been insanely consistent since 2023 . Every year, fans get new Apothecary Diaries content, and 2026 might just be the biggest year for the franchise yet. Not only is The Apothecary Diaries Season 3 on the way for the fans, but fans are also expecting a new movie as well. This new movie will come out in December 2026 , and it will be a brand-new original story from the creator of the series . Solo Leveling Movie Solo Leveling is a great series that has taken the world by storm. Nobody expected this short series to become as popular as it is today, especially overseas. Fans have been obsessed with Jinwoo’s story, and the studio is definitely capitalizing on that. While fans were disappointed to not get any Solo Leveling Season 3 news, the reason for its delay might just be the new Solo Leveling movie that was revealed in a production committee report . The Solo Leveling movie is anticipated to release in 2026 , but it’s not yet set in stone. What events the movie could cover is unknown, but seeing what the anime seasons have delivered so far, it can only be exciting for the fans. That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime: The Movie – Tears of the Azure Sea Isekai is quite an oversaturated genre, but among all the series featured in it, the one that has stood out from the rest is That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime . At this moment, it can safely be said that That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime is Japan’s biggest Isekai series. Related The Biggest Anime Of 2026 (So Far) 2026 is almost here, and the upcoming year should be PACKED with both massive anime sequels and newcomers. Let's go through its biggest anime. Posts 4 By Mark Sammut With such huge success, fans aren’t surprised to see it getting a huge movie soon, titled That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime: The Movie – Tears of the Azure Sea , and it’s set to drop on February 27, 2026 , in Japan. Fans are excited to see Rimuru’s next adventure on the big screen. Paris ni Saku Étoile Paris ni Saku Étoile, also known as L'étoile de Paris en fleur , is an original movie that’s most certainly going to gain great traction in Japan. The story for this movie was written by Reiko Yoshida, and fans have high expectations for what it could deliver. After all, she is the iconic mangaka who worked on Tokyo Mew Mew, one of the biggest magical girl series of all time. Not much is known about the plot of Paris ni Saku Étoile, but it will take place in Paris in the 1900s. The story follows two Japanese girls, one who wants to become a ballerina, and one whose goal is to become a painter. This movie is sure to warm the hearts of fans and it will drop on March 13, 2026. Cosmic Princess Kaguya! Stepping away from big-name franchises, Cosmic Princess Kaguya! is a new movie coming in 2026 that could definitely surprise fans with what it could deliver. This movie is going to reimagine the well-known Japanese story of The Bamboo Cutter, via Studio Colorido and Studio Chromato. This movie is about to feature some incredible music from Vocaloid Producers and will bring a fresh take on the beloved folklore story. This movie, sadly, won’t be coming to theaters. Fans can instead watch it on Netflix starting January 22, 2026.
